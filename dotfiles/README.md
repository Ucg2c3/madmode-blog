Mostly I avoid bespoke configuration to minimize friction when I
outfit a new computer or use someone else's.

But I also have a habit of using version control to record when I
learned things; for example:

At KUMC, I did a lot of data science work with jupyter, pandas,
and such. Whoever argued with me about conda at that PyData
conference, you were right:

While working on rholang, I tried to use emacs for scala dev. It works
OK as a text editor, but a type-aware IDE with integrated test runner
and such is a big boost. Intellij IDEA just works; I never did get
ensime really working.

Agoric is all about JavaScript. We use typescript types (mostly in
JSDoc). I miss flow:

But Agoric is also the first place since Convex in the '90s
where I've done C development:
