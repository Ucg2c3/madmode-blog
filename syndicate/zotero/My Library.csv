The finding discusses the relationship between the URI addressability of a resource and the choice between HTTP GET and POST methods with HTTP URIs. HTTP GET promotes URI addressability so, designers should adopt it for safe operations such as simple queries. POST is appropriate for other types of applications where a user request has the potential to change the state of the resource (or of related resources). The finding explains how to choose between HTTP GET and POST for an application taking into account architectural, security, and practical considerations.

This GRDDL specification introduces markup based on existing standards for declaring that an XML document includes data compatible with the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and for linking to algorithms (typically represented in XSLT), for extracting this data from the document. The markup includes a namespace-qualified attribute for use in general-purpose XML documents and a profile-qualified link relationship for use in valid XHTML documents. The GRDDL mechanism also allows an XML namespace document (or XHTML profile document) to declare that every document associated with that namespace (or profile) includes gleanable data and for linking to an algorithm for gleaning the data. A corresponding GRDDL Use Case Working Draft provides motivating examples. A GRDDL Primer demonstrates the mechanism on XHTML documents which include widely-deployed dialects known as microformats. A GRDDL Test Cases document illustrates specific issues in this design and provides materials to aid in test-driven development of GRDDL-aware agents.","2007-09-11","2013-08-09 00:43:15","2013-08-09 04:00:23","","","","","","","","","","","","W3C Technical Reports","W3C","","","Copyright © 2006-2007 W3C® (MIT, ERCIM, Keio), All Rights Reserved.

HTML provides one simple format for    providing linked information, and  all W3 compatible programs are    required to be capable of handling HTML.    W3 uses an Internet ⬚    protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP), which allows transfer    representations to be negotiated between client and server, the    result being returned in an extended MIME message.  HTML is    therefore just one, but an important one, of the representations    used with W3.        HTML is proposed as a  MIME content type.        HTML refers to the URL specification of RFCxxxx.        Implementations of HTML parsers and generators can be found in the    various W3 servers and browsers, in the public domain W3 code, and    may also be built using various public domain SGML parsers such as    [SGMLS] .  HTML is an SGML document type with fairly generic    semantics appropriate for representing information from a wide    range of applications.  It is more generic than many specific SGML    applications, but is still completely device-independent.","1993-06","2013-08-09 02:38:44","2013-08-09 02:40:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Adding logic to the Web implies the use of rules to make inferences, choose courses of action, and answer questions. This logic must be powerful enough to describe complex properties of objects but not so powerful that agents can be tricked by being asked to consider a paradox. The Web has several characteristics that can lead to problems when existing logics are used, in particular, the inconsistencies that inevitably arise due to the openness of the Web, where anyone can assert anything. N3Logic is a logic that allows rules to be expressed in a Web environment. It extends RDF with syntax for nested graphs and quantified variables and with predicates for implication and accessing resources on the Web, and functions including cryptographic, string, math. The main goal of N3Logic is to be a minimal extension to the RDF data model such that the same language can be used for logic and data. In this paper, we describe N3Logic and illustrate through examples why it is an appropriate logic for the Web.","2008-05","2013-08-09 00:43:15","2013-08-09 01:14:53","","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The local flowsheet ontology contained 720 “templates” employing 5,379 groups (2,678 distinct), 37,836 measures (13,659 distinct) containing 226,666 choices for a total size of 270,641.

Ontologies have been shown to have significant benefits for computational analyses of large data sets and for automated reasoning applications, leading to organized attempts to improve the structure and formal rigor of ontologies to better support computation. Currently, the CL employs multiple is_a relations, defining cell types in terms of histological, functional, and lineage properties, and the majority of definitions are written with sufficient generality to hold across multiple species. This approach limits the CL's utility for computation and for cross-species data integration. RESULTS: To enhance the CL's utility for computational analyses, we developed a method for the ontological representation of cells and applied this method to develop a dendritic cell ontology (DC-CL). DC-CL subtypes are delineated on the basis of surface protein expression, systematically including both species-general and species-specific types and optimizing DC-CL for the analysis of flow cytometry data. We avoid multiple uses of is_a by linking DC-CL terms to terms in other ontologies via additional, formally defined relations such as has_function. CONCLUSION: This approach brings benefits in the form of increased accuracy, support for reasoning, and interoperability with other ontology resources. Accordingly, we propose our method as a general strategy for the ontological representation of cells.

These interactions are mediated by cell-surface glycoproteins and glycolipids. Antibodies against these leukocyte molecules have provided powerful tools for analysis of their structure, function, and distribution. Antibodies have been used widely in hematology, immunology, and pathology, and in research, diagnosis, and therapy. The associated CD nomenclature is commonly used when referring to leukocyte surface molecules and antibodies against them. It provides an essential classification for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The most recent (8th) Workshop and Conference on Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens (HLDA), held in Adelaide, Australia, in December 2004, allocated 95 new CD designations and made radical changes to its aims and future operational strategy in order to maintain its relevance to modern human biology and clinical practice.","2005-11-01","2010-03-31 17:51:40","2010-03-31 17:51:40","2010-03-31 17:51:40","3123-3126","","9","106","","","CD molecules 2005","","","","","","","","","","","","HighWire","","","","/home/connolly/Zotero/storage/V7NSPGFK/3123.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We recognize the importance of policies for securing the Web and believe that the future will only bring more policy languages. We do not, however, believe that users should be forced to conform the description of their policy relationships to a single standard policy language. Instead there should be a way of encompassing different policy languages and supporting heterogeneous policy systems. As a step in this direction, we propose Rein, a policy framework grounded in Semantic Web technologies, which leverages the distributed nature and linkability of the Web to provide Web-based policy management. Rein provides ontologies for describing policy domains in a decentralized manner and provides an engine for reasoning over these descriptions, both of which can be used to develop domain and policy language specific security systems. We describe the Rein policy framework and discuss how a Rein policy management systems can be developed for access control in an online photo sharing application.","2006","2013-08-09 00:43:15","2013-11-26 02:32:00","","1337","","","21","","","","","","","","AAAI Press","Boston, Massachusetts","","","","","","","","","","/home/connolly/Zotero/storage/8SIX4BD4/download.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","THE TWENTY-FIRST NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its mission is to provide clinical investigators with the tools necessary to integrate medical record and clinical research data in the genomics age, a software suite to construct and integrate the modern clinical research chart. i2b2 software may be used by an enterprise's research community to find sets of interesting patients from electronic patient medical record data, while preserving patient privacy through a query tool interface. Project-specific mini-databases (“data marts”) can be created from these sets to make highly detailed data available on these specific patients to the investigators on the i2b2 platform, as reviewed and restricted by the Institutional Review Board. The current version of this software has been released into the public domain and is available at the URL: http://www.i2b2.org/software.","2010-03-01","2013-10-10 21:17:48","2013-11-26 02:31:31","2013-10-10 21:17:48","124-130","","2","17","","J Am Med Inform Assoc","","","","","","","","en","","","","","jamia.bmj.com","","PMID: 20190053","","; /home/connolly/Zotero/storage/UE3BZXP8/Murphy et al. - 2010 - Serving the enterprise and beyond with informatics.pdf; /home/connolly/Zotero/storage/PCH5EIKR/124.html; /home/connolly/Zotero/storage/XM6N5EQS/124.html; ; /home/connolly/Zotero/storage/96DHZZSN/Murphy et al. - 2010 - Serving the enterprise and beyond with informatics.pdf; /home/connolly/Zotero/storage/BVISIHSU/Murphy et al. - 2010 - Serving the enterprise and beyond with informatics.pdf; /home/connolly/Zotero/storage/QXV54RUS/124.html; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20190053; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20190053; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20190053","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pivoting approaches have not been described in depth in the literature, and existing descriptions are dated. We describe and benchmark three alternative algorithms to perform pivoting of clinical data in the context of a clinical study data management system. We conclude that when the number of attributes to be returned is not too large, it is feasible to use static SQL as the basis for views on the data. An alternative but more complex approach that utilizes hash tables and the presence of abundant random-access-memory can achieve improved performance by reducing the load on the database server.","2006-04","2013-10-10 21:31:12","2013-10-10 21:31:12","","38-43","","1","82","","Comput Methods Programs Biomed","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","NCBI PubMed","","PMID: 16556470","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16556470","","Humans; Clinical Trials as Topic; Software; Algorithms; Automatic Data Processing; Medical Informatics Applications; Medical Records; United States","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, over recent decades, the potential for additional data collection and analyses to be conducted within the framework of a registry has been recognised and utilised. This is evident by the sheer number of registries that are now referenced in the medical literature, covering a vast array of therapeutic areas and topics much more varied than incidence, prevalence and survival. The opportunity to collect QOL and pharmacoeconomic data has been utilised within the registry framework as more and more countries have increased their demands for such information for regulatory procedures, including pricing and reimbursement decisions. This increased need for information has led to a marked increase in the number of registries undertaken that are primarily sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. Disease registries offer tremendous opportunities to realise improvements in care. The length of data collection and the large number of patients involved offer some unusual advantages for QOL and health economic analyses; however, these advantages are not yet fully exploited.","2004","2013-10-10 21:27:20","2013-10-10 21:27:20","","551-568","","9","22","","Pharmacoeconomics","Global registries for measuring pharmacoeconomic and quality-of-life outcomes","","","","","","","eng","","","","","NCBI PubMed","","PMID: 15209525","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15209525","","Humans; Data Collection; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Drug Therapy; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Quality of Life; Registries; Research Design; World Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As new information arrives, a decision-maker may not remember all the rea- sons he began a project. The initial sunk cost gives additional infor- mation about future net profits and should inform subsequent deci- sions. We show that in different environments, this can generate two forms of sunk cost bias. The Concorde effect makes the investor more eager to complete projects when sunk costs are high and the pro-rata effect makes the investor less eager. The relative magnitude of these effects determines the overall direction of the sunk cost bias. In a labo- ratory experiment we had subjects play a simple version of the model. In a baseline treatment with no memory constraints subjects exhibit the pro-rata bias. When we induce memory constraints the effect re- verses and the subjects exhibit the Concorde bias. Keywords: sunk-cost bias, Concorde effect, pro-rata fallacy, escalation of commitment, kludge.","2009-03-13","2013-08-10 21:28:47","2013-08-10 21:30:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/home/connolly/Zotero/storage/HTDMPM3S/29 Baliga Mnemonomics.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the relationship between type 2 diabetes (DM) and BPPV is unclear. The purpose of this retrospective study was to examine the relationship between DM and BPPV in the presence of known contributors like age, gender and hypertension. METHODS: A retrospective review of the records of 3933 individuals was categorized by the specific vestibular diagnosis and for the presence of type 2 DM and hypertension. As the prevalence of BPPV was higher in people with type 2 DM compared to those without DM, multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify variables predictive of BPPV. The relationship between type 2 DM, hypertension and BPPV was analyzed using mediation analysis. RESULTS: BPPV was seen in 46% of individuals with type 2 DM, compared to 37% of individuals without DM (p< 0.001). Forty two percent of the association between type 2 DM and BPPV was mediated by hypertension, and supported hypertension as a complete mediator in the relationship between type 2 DM and BPPV. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension may provide the mediating pathway by which diabetes affects the vestibular system. Individuals with complaints of dizziness, with comorbidities including hypertension and diabetes, may benefit from a screening for BPPV.","2016","2017-03-24 18:56:33","2017-03-24 18:56:33","","","","","","","J Vestib Res","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>databuilder pilot</p>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These hazards limit the scale and functionality of the software systems we can successfully compose. This dissertation presents a framework for enabling those interactions between components needed for the cooperation we intend, while minimizing the hazards of destructive interference. Great progress on the composition problem has been made within the object paradigm, chiefly in the context of sequential, single-machine programming among benign components. We show how to extend this success to support robust composition of concurrent and potentially malicious components distributed over potentially malicious machines. We present E, a distributed, persistent, secure programming language, and CapDesk, a virus-safe desktop built in E, as embodiments of the techniques we explain.","2006","2015-03-14 15:02:56","2016-10-15 20:40:24","2015-03-14 15:02:56","","","","","","","Robust composition","","","","","Johns Hopkins University","","","","","","","Google Scholar","","","","/home/connolly/Zotero/storage/QCVI7KT6/markm-thesis.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This movement, called “open peer review”, will require infrastructure. So far, proposed realizations of open peer review have relied on centralized coordinating platforms; this is unsatisfactory as this architectural choice stays vulnerable to long-term predatory commercial capture and data loss. Instead, we propose “Academia 2.0”, a combination of both true peer-to-peer, distributed scientific dissemination channels, and their accompanying workflows for open peer review. It features safe decoupling of storage, indexing and search sites and supports research metrics. Our proposal relies on the existence of semantic web sites for researchers and powerful Internet search engines, an assumption which did not hold 10 years ago. We also introduce post-hoc citations, a key mechanism for quality control, impact measurement and post-hoc credit attribution for previous work. Due to the technology involved, computer engineering is likely the scientific field with the most potential to try out and evaluate our model.","2014-06","2016-07-28 00:39:53","2016-07-28 00:39:53","","3:1–3:6","","","","","","","","","","","ACM","Edinburgh, UK","","","","","","","","","","/home/connolly/Zotero/storage/C4H7NJKI/poss.14.trust.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, current for- mal characterisations do not fully capture capability-safety of a programming language and are not sufficient for verifying typical applications. Using state-of-the-art techniques from programming languages research, we define a logical relation for a core calculus of JavaScript that better characterises capability-safety. The relation is powerful enough to reason about typical capability patterns and supports evolvable in- variants on shared data structures, capabilities with restricted authority over them and isolated components with restricted communication channels. We use a novel notion of effect parametricity for deriving properties about effects. Our results imply memory access bounds that have previously been used to characterise capability-safety.","2016-03-23","2016-03-25 19:51:40","2021-12-25 23:00:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","cap-talk","Congress Center Saar, Saarbrücken, GERMANY","","","","","","","","from:	Dominique Devriese <dominique.devriese@cs.kuleuven.be> to:	cap-talk@mail.eros-os.org date:	Thu, Mar 24, 2016 at 5:57 AM subject:	[cap-talk] Reasoning about Object Capabilities using Logical Relations and Effect Parametricity","","/home/connolly/Zotero/storage/2RN2GSBZ/CW690.pdf; /home/connolly/Zotero/storage/Q9RUHCJC/obj-cap-log-rel-eff-param.pdf; /home/connolly/Zotero/storage/HSSVI92K/paper-preprint.pdf; /home/connolly/Zotero/storage/JMUZI8B5/Devriese et al. - 2016 - Reasoning about Object Capabilities with Logical R.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1st IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using i2b2 and REDCap, (IDR and EDC platforms respectively) we have developed methods that integrate IDR and EDC strengths supporting: 1) data delivery from the IDR as ready-to-use registries to exploit the annotation and data collection capabilities unique to EDC applications; 2) integrating EDC managed registries into data repositories allows investigators to use hypothesis generation and cohort discovery methods. This round-trip integration can lower lag between cohort discovery and establishing a registry. Investigators can also periodically augment their registry cohort as the IDR is enriched with additional data elements, data sources, and patients. We describe our open-source automated methods and provide three example registry uses cases for these methods: triple negative breast cancer, vertiginous syndrome, cancer distress.","2013-10-11","2014-04-22 14:29:19","2014-04-22 14:30:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/home/connolly/Zotero/storage/4J9Q6EBU/1861442_File000002.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we describe a reusable environment (GPC Reusable Observable Uniﬁed Study Environment [GROUSE]) that integrates hospital and electronic health records (EHRs) data with state-wide Medicare and Medicaid claims and assess how claims and clinical data complement each other to identify obesity and related comorbidities in a patient sample. Materials and Methods: EHR, billing, and tumor registry data from 7 healthcare systems were integrated with Center for Medicare (2011–2016) and Medicaid (2011–2012) services insurance claims to create deidentiﬁed databases in Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside and PCORnet Common Data Model formats. We describe technical details of how this federally compliant, cloud-based data environment was built. As a use case, trends in obesity rates for different age groups are reported, along with the relative contribution of claims and EHR data-to-data completeness and detecting common comorbidities. Results: GROUSE contained 73 billion observations from 24 million unique patients (12.9 million Medicare; 13.9 million Medicaid; 6.6 million GPC patients) with 1 674 134 patients crosswalked and 983 450 patients with body mass index (BMI) linked to claims. Diagnosis codes from EHR and claims sources underreport obesity by 2.56 times compared with body mass index measures. However, common comorbidities such as diabetes and sleep apnea diagnoses were more often available from claims diagnoses codes (1.6 and 1.4 times, respectively). Conclusion: GROUSE provides a uniﬁed EHR-claims environment to address health system and federal privacy concerns, which enables investigators to generalize analyses across health systems integrated with multistate insurance claims.","2021-12-13","2021-12-25 22:40:12","2021-12-25 23:00:43","2021-12-25 22:40:12","ocab269","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>ocab269</p>","/home/connolly/Zotero/storage/BDRWKMVN/Waitman et al. - 2021 - Enhancing PCORnet Clinical Research Network data c.pdf; /home/connolly/Zotero/storage/FQYXEAIG/Waitman et al. - 2021 - Enhancing PCORnet Clinical Research Network data c.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
