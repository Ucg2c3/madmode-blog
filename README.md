Abstractâ€”Motivated by the problem of understanding the
difference between practical access control and capability
systems formally, we distill the essence of both in a language-
based setting. We first prove that access control systems and
(object) capabilities are fundamentally different. We further
study capabilities as an enforcement mechanism for confused
deputy attacks (CDAs), since CDAs may have been the primary
motivation for the invention of capabilities. To do this, we
develop the first formal characterization of CDA-freedom in
a language-based setting and describe its relation to standard
information flow integrity. We show that, perhaps suprisingly,
capabilities cannot prevent all CDAs. Next, we stipulate re-
strictions on programs under which capabilities ensure CDA-
freedom and prove that the restrictions are sufficient. To relax
those restrictions, we examine provenance semantics as sound
CDA-freedom enforcement mechanisms.
