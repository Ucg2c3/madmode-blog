I know what the <i>Software Engineer</i> part means; I have been doing that since my first job out of school in 1990. But the <i>Biomedical Informatics</i> part I'll have to learn, real quick.<br />
<br />

A couple years ago, I started prospecting for some supplemental consulting work; in <cite><a href="http://www.madmode.com/2008/01/from-kc-to-mit-and-back-again.html">From KC to MIT and back again</a></cite>, I wrote:<br />
<blockquote>
My family is here in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Metropolitan_Area">KC</a> but my work is at MIT and Silicon Valley and Vancouver and Edinburgh and Beijing... mostly over the Internet, supplemented by travel schedule of about one trip a month. After working remotely for 10 years, I'm interested to mix in a little more local collaboration.</blockquote>
Little did I know that a year later, the recession would catch up to W3C and my position at MIT would be reduced to half time and that supplemental consulting would become essential. The first gig I found was more HTML 5 work, with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.w3.org/News/2009.html#entry-6709">funding from Adobe</a>. Then something pretty different came up: working with Science Commons, on data integration to support research on autoimmune diseases.<br />
<br />
The bulk of the work was just decoding data from the protein databank and such and using semantic web techniques to normalize it; pretty tedious&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">ETL</a>&nbsp;stuff, except that I had to learn all about genetics and the human leukocyte antigen (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen">HLA</a>) while I was at it. I could just <i>barely</i> keep up with the presentations at the <a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx">NAID</a> bioinformatics summit.<br />
<br />
In the last few weeks of the project I got to do a <a href="http://neurocommons.org/page/ImmPort/JmolViz">3D visualization demo</a>.<br />

<br />
After this pilot project, we wrote a proposal for follow-on work, and it got positive technical reviews, but &nbsp; somehow the funding didn't materialize.<br />
<br />
But now I had a new keyword to use when looking for work: bioinformatics. That's how I found this new position, just a few miles from my home, in the&nbsp;<a href="http://biostatistics.kumc.edu/">department of biostatistics at the University of Kansas Medical center</a>. They're putting together an informatics team to round out their qualifications for a Clinical and Translational Science Award (<a href="http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/clinical_research_resources/clinical_and_translational_science_awards/">CTSA</a>), and I'm excited to be part of it.
