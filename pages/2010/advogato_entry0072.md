<b>On building a Linux box, from
December 1995</b>

<p> I'm purging files, and I think the <b>9505 Beach
Hardware</b> folder can go. <tt>beach.w3.org</tt> was
the box I put together for my desktop in May 1995
when I arrived at MIT. It was a PowerSpec from Micro Center.
In the folder are my 18
Dec 95 Debian upgrade notes, including gems such as:

<p> <blockquote>
<pre>
mknod 22 0
mount -t iso9660 -oro /dev/cdrom /cdrom
</pre>

<p> dsselect detected the CDROM!
</blockquote>

<p> Also in this folder is a printed article:

<p> <ul>
<li>
<cite><a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2084">Building the
Perfect Box: How To Design Your Linux
Workstation</a></cite><br>
by Eric S. Raymond<br>
Linux Journal April 1997

</ul>

<p> Props to Linux Journal for keeping good archives!
