title: chorded keyboard for android, anyone?
updated: 2010-10-07


<div>I don't miss a physical keyboard when I want to text "Did you feed the dogs?" messages. Swype and voice input work better.</div><div><br />
</div><div>But anything much longer than that involves editing, which is really hard to do without chorded key combinations such as shift-select with arrow keys and mod+x/c/v/z for cut/copy/paste/undo.</div><div><br />
</div><div>The web browser and photo browser make good use of multi-touch. Why isn't there a keyboard alternative that uses it for chorded input?</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #333333; font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 20px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: normal;"><br />
