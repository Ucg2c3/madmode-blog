title: Getting over blogging tool analysis paralysis
updated: 2010-06-02


I'm right there with <a href="http://joshua.schachter.org/2009/12/blogging-tools.html">Joshua</a> when he writes:<br />
<blockquote>I haven't really written anything for this blog in a while.<br />
There are a variety of reasons for this, but I'm generally pretty sensitive to my tools, and I haven't been thrilled with either what I am currently using or what I might use in the future. Do I want to use Wordpress on a virtual machine at some hosting provider? Do I want to write something custom on AppEngine? Or one of a dozen dozen other choices? It makes me want to lie down.</blockquote><br />
<a name='more'></a>In Feb 2009, I was looking at <a href="http://advogato.org/person/connolly/diary/64.html">drupal vs. wordpress and such</a>.&nbsp;I'm writing this in/on google's blogger because:<br />
<br />
<ul><li>I'm tired of the primitive editing support at <a href="http://advogato.org/">advogato</a>  (especially the way it mangles my paragraphs)</li>
<li>We can't manage comment spam in our <a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node">breadcrumbs</a> research group blog.</li>
<li>I can't manage my own wordpress install (a friendly expert told me that my barn door was open w.r.t. security; fortunately before any unfriendly experts came along)</li>
<li>Google lets me use my own domain name, for free (wordpress.com charges $10/year). And it encourages me to run ads. I'm still thinking that over.</li>
<li>Google's <a href="http://www.dataliberation.org/">data liberation front</a> makes me confident I can get my data back out again.</li>
</ul>I'm also using chrome. I mostly got it going for google calendar, which bogs down firefox. App-specific browsers are clearly the way to go... mozilla prism doesn't seem to have a big enough userbase to be polished, where chrome's application tabs show that it takes this idea seriously.<br />
<br />
Oh... and years after <a href="http://advogato.org/person/connolly/diary/51.html">buying this dual-core amd64 machine</a>, I finally installed 64bit ubuntu. More on that in another episode of madmode...
