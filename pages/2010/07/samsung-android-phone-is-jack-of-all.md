title: Samsung Android phone is a jack of all trades, master of none
updated: 2011-12-12


Smartphones let you carry a phone, a PDA, GPS, music, photos and lots more all in one device. But remember when you could call your sweetie just by picking up your phone and holding down the 2 key? &nbsp; &nbsp;If I pick up my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TXSKNE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=danconnolly&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003TXSKNE">Samsung Vibrant Android Phone</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=danconnolly&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B003TXSKNE" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />, first of all there is no 2 key, but if there were, it might just add to an email draft or pick the second photo from a list or any number of other things, depending on what I asked my phone to do when I last used it.<br />
<br />
And yet I wear the thing practically everywhere; the only things it hasn't (yet!) replaced are my watch, wallet, and keys.<br />
<br />
It's going to take a whole madmode series to explore the list of things it has replaced, or at least competes with:<br />
<ul>
<li>PDA&nbsp;(which, of course, replaced a paper calendar, todo list, and address book)</li>
<li>cellphone</li>
<li>ipod (portable CD player, CD collection)</li>
<li>camera</li>
<li>videocamera</li>
<li>barcode reader</li>
<li>GPS (map, compass)</li>
<li>wallet photos</li>
<li>stopwatch</li>
<li>alarm clock</li>
<li>book</li>
<li>laptop</li>
</ul>
I wonder how long until I can retire my wallet. I gather the Japanese have pretty much done it. I hoped for QR codes on recepts... I think there's a place for paper... but it looks like we'll leapfrog that and go right to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Field_Communication">NFC</a>&nbsp;for mobile payments.<br />
