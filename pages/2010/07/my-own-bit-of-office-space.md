title: My own bit of office space... come join the fun?
updated: 2010-09-17


The cube I work in is pretty typical, I guess, but I'm going through a bit of culture shock after 13 years of working out of an office in my home. Look what my wife got me to celebrate the transition:<br />

How thoughtful... she confirmed that this is the <i>exact</i> model that Milton valued more than his job in <i>Office Space</i>:<br />
<blockquote><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;"><b><a href="http://www.blogger.com/name/nm0740535/" style="color: #003399;">Milton Waddams</a></b>: [<i class="fine">talking on the phone</i>] And I said, I don't care if they lay me off either, because I told, I told Bill that if they move my desk one more time, then, then I'm, I'm quitting, I'm going to quit. And, and I told Don too, because they've moved my desk four times already this year, and I used to be over by the window, and I could see the squirrels, and they were merry, but then, they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline stapler because it didn't bind up as much, and I kept the staples for the Swingline stapler and it's not okay because if they take my stapler then I'll set the building on fire...&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/quotes?qt0386878">imdb</a>)</span></div></blockquote>I'm not really that picky about staplers, but one of the first things that bugged me about life in a cube was the distracting sounds, and back when I spent a lot of time on airplanes, my thoughtful wife got me something that comes in handy for that: a pair of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000089GN2/danconnollyA/">Sennheiser PXC 250 Active Noise Canceling Headphones</a>. When I put those on and tune in to&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.last.fm/user/DanConnolly/neighbours">my last.fm neighborhood</a>, I can maintain <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MentalStateCalledFlow">flow state</a> just fine.<br />
<br />
Plus, working on campus has its benefits. At <a href="http://www.kumc.edu/kirmayer/">the fitness center</a>,&nbsp;Jeff's boot camp class has me sucking wind so badly I couldn't possibly worry about anything else. Or sometimes I'm just up for a few laps (salt water pool!) and a soak in the hot tub.<br />
<br />
The reason I'm in a cube is that our department is growing in people faster than it's growing in space. If you'd like to join the fun, we're hiring! Consider applying:<br />
