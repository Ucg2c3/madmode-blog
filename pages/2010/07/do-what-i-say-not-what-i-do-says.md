title: '"Do what I say, not what I do," says the enterprise training calendar'

How ironic! The registration confirmation message for the&nbsp;<span style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">GroupWise for New Employees</span> class doesn't have a machine-readable calendar invitation attached.<br />
<br />
It does have an HTML description of the event that's clearly machine-generated:<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_qlST3d9vnWA/TCyz5iAPvaI/AAAAAAAAAAc/Pyk16yfqK1Y/s1600/training-event.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/_qlST3d9vnWA/TCyz5iAPvaI/AAAAAAAAAAc/Pyk16yfqK1Y/s320/training-event.png" /></a></div>Oh for <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar">hCalendar</a>!<br />
<br />
That is: if the registration system added just a little hCalendar markup, and if GroupWise grokk'd hCalendar, then we'd be all set. Or if the registration system added hCalendar markup and used it to generate a .ics version.<br />
<br />
<i>Hmm... does GroupWise actually support .ics attachments from other systems? Or is it just because I'm using Evolution as my GroupWise client that I think this would work?</i>
