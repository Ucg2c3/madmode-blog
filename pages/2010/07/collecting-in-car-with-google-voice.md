title: Collecting in the Car with google voice
updated: 2010-07-13


I commute about 45 minutes to work now, after over a decade of working from an office in my home. &nbsp;I'm OK to listen passively to music and such sometimes, but alone time is a great time to think and <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/07/24/b2gtd-mind-sweep">mind-sweep</a>, and nothing is more frustrating than having an idea and having no way to collect it somewhere other than in my head.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_qlST3d9vnWA/TDy08RcxZVI/AAAAAAAAAAk/_w2oYjKMew0/s1600/Screenshot.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/_qlST3d9vnWA/TDy08RcxZVI/AAAAAAAAAAk/_w2oYjKMew0/s320/Screenshot.png" /></a></div>I just found a few minutes to set up speech to text using my cell phone and <a href="https://www.google.com/">google voice</a>.<br />
<br />
<a name='more'></a>What I actually said was "Let's see if I can leave voice <i>notes</i> to myself..." not "voice<i>mail</i> to myself" but it's certainly a useful transcription.<br />
<br />
I first got the idea when I learned that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyTouch_3G_Slide">T-Mobile myTouch 3G slide</a> has dragon dictate for transcription right there on the phone, as well as the normal androide send-it-to-the-mothership style transcription. But I checked the marketplace before buying one and found the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S">Samsung Galaxy S</a> on the horizon with twice the resolution and twice the CPU speed (both needed for Gingerbread, the next version of Android), so I'm holding out. I wonder how much I'd miss the keyboard. But that's another story. Back to transcription...<br />
<br />
I was frustrated by my first attempt to set this up because calls from my mobile phone would go straight to voicemail, and at that point, there's <b>no way to leave a message for myself!&nbsp;</b>The trick is to use the "advanced settings" to tell google voice not to go straight to voicemail:<br />

</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Now when I call my google voice number from my mobile phone, it treats me like anybody else who might want to leave me a message. And of course with google voice, I get text that I can scan and search, not just audio that has to be played back at the same speed it was recorded.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br />
