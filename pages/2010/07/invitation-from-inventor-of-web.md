<div style="text-align: left;"><b>Update</b>: I heard from about <a href="http://twitter.com/dckc/danfest/members">50 colleagues around the web</a> last night. Fun!</div><br />
Tim has declared a <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/semantic-web/2010Jul/0300.html">#DanFest for Dan Connolly Wed July 14th</a>:<br />
<br />

<br />
<blockquote>Assorted folks,<br />
<br />
As you may know, recently Dan Connolly left the W3C team after very many years of invaluable service to the web community. Following an idea of Bijan's, we will have a distributed #DanFest.<br />
<br />
<ul><li>Date: Wednesday July 14&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Time: 7pm Central, 8pm Eastern.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><br />
The idea is that people all over the place dine in celebration of Dan's many accomplishments while at W3C.&nbsp;Then, half an hour after the official start of the meal,<br />
<br />
<ul><li>Time: 7:30 Central, 8:30 pm Eastern: we toast Dan simultaneously. &lt;------&nbsp;</li>
</ul><br />
We may try to Videoskype Dan in to the team near MIT.<br />
<br />
<br />
We realize people in different timezones will not be able to dine at the same time, so eating is a timezone-sepcific thing. Those in France, please set of fireworks to mark the occasion.<br />
Tweets should be sent at the time, and of course can point to other things.<br />
<br />

<a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim</a></blockquote>My family and I will be on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Club_Plaza">the plaza</a> for the event. Wherever you are, I look forward to hearing from you, and I'm sure Tim does too.<br />
<br />
For a guy who played a pivotal role in a whole new era of communication among humans, Tim Berners-Lee is a relatively unknown figure. Our culture celebrates fame, fortune, and power, while Tim is all about sharing. It's been my honor to do what I could to help him out over the last decade and a half at W3C, not to mention a blast working with all the other people who contribute so much to making the web work.<br />

If you have never heard of the guy who brought hypertext and the Internet together, please spend a few minutes watching this video:<br />
