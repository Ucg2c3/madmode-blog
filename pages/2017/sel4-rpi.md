I got seL4 running on my Raspberry Pi 3B tonight.

Even though I worked with Dale Dougherty in the early '90s,
I've been on the sidelines of the whole maker thing until September when
Micro Center bundled a [Google AIY VOICE KIT with Raspberry Pi 3B for $35][AIY].

After I verified that it works as a voice device, I remembered the tantalizing
[seL4 on the Raspberry Pi 3][SR] item from early this year. The build dependencies
were greatly simplified by the [seL4 dockerfiles][DF]. Building the seL4-Test project
went without a hitch:

    mkdir sel4test && cd sel4test
    repo init --config-name -u git@github.com:seL4/sel4test-manifest.git
    repo sync
    make rpi3_debug_xml_defconfig && make
    ...
    [GEN_IMAGE] sel4test-driver-image-arm-bcm2837

The only way to see the seL4 test project do its thing is via the serial console.
Before I overwrote the working voice kit SD card, I wanted to test connectivity.
I have plenty of experience with RS-232 serial cables (I even had a job in high
school where I helped a tech by putting together serial terminal cables)
but [RS-232 vs. TTL serial](https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/215) is not just
a matter of wires and connectors; the voltage levels are different. USB to TTL cables
usually go for around $15, which is more than half of what I paid for the Pi!

Meanwhile, this summer Micro Center had a beaglebone green wireless, which
usually goes for around $50, on clearance for $20, and I couldn't pass it up.
The beaglebone uses the same TTL levels and works fine as an ssh server,
so I put together a cable

After some `config-pin` tinkering, I confirmed that I could get
UART1 and UART2 on the beaglebone to talk to each other (UART0
is debug outputonly), but I couldn't get any console output from the Pi to show up.

After discovering a [JBtek Raspberry Pi USB to TTL Serial Cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QT7LQ88/)
on Amazon for $7, I ordered it and set the project aside.

That didn't work either until I connected an HDMI monitor and keyboard and
used `raspi-config` to enable the serial console. _I wonder if the beaglebone
would have worked given that fix._

With serial console hardware issues in hand, I loaded the SD card as instructed.
The first few boot stages worked, but I struggled to `Hit any key to stop autoboot`.
Minicom (remember minicom?) showed "Offline" so I turned off hardware flow control.
Bingo:
