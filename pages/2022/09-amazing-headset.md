It was loud. I mean **really** loud. Like guns going off over my head.
The noise from the nailguns and hammers from the hardwood floor installation
going on right above my office.

I apologized to the other folks in the meeting about the background noise,
but since my business in the meeting was urgent and the noise
wasn't going to get any better, I pressed on.

They dind't hear it. At all. They reported my voice was coming through
just fine.

I still hardly believe it.

Hats off to Corsair!

And thanks, B!
