One of my favorite patterns of cooperation is <dfn>Office Hours</dfn>.
I open my office, virtually, and welcome questions and other open discussion,
mostly about the way [object capabilities](http://erights.org/) can be used to form patterns
of cooperation without vulnerabilities, but also wider discussion of Web Architecture,
open source, project management... and occasionally, to fill gaps, guitar :)

[Agoric Dev Office Hours](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/wiki/Office-Hours)
on Wednesdays is the main series these days.

[Notes with video recordings](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/discussions/categories/office-hours?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3A%22Office+Hours%22+label%3Avideo-recording)
are the norm. [All episodes](https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/discussions/categories/office-hours?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3A%22Office+Hours%22+)
have at least a tab dump of the links discussed in the session
(_thanks to the [TabCopy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabcopy/micdllihgoppmejpecmkilggmaagfdmb) extension_).

There's a lot going on at Agoric!

I started doing Saturday [RChain community building office hours: Story Telling and Test Cases](https://github.com/rchain/bounties/issues/403) in 2018.
but as the [RChain Blues](/2019/rchain-blues) set in, I re-scoped
my Saturday time as [awesome-ocap office hours](https://github.com/dckc/awesome-ocap/issues/22).

I haven't had critical mass on a Saturday morning for a while,
so I join [Hack & Craft](https://fossandcrafts.org/hack-and-craft/) now and then.
Darn... this is an off week; they only run 1st and 3rd Saturdays of the month.
