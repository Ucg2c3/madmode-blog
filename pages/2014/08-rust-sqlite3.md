summary: Inspired by sfackler's rust-postgres, I started from scratch...

I was looking into [sandstorm][], a personal cloud platform with an
architecture based on the wonderful [capability security][capsec]
paradigm, and I found a rust application, [acronymy][], that uses the
native API rather than the traditional POSIX environment.

I started poring over the code and followed the dependency link to
linuxfood's [rustsqlite][]. I started working on a [memory safety
issue][92] etc. but soon found a number of large-scale API design
issues that I wasn't sure how to approach with the upstream
developers. I was also inspired by `FromSql`, `ToSql` and such
from sfackler's [rust-postgres] API.

So I started from scratch, using [bindgen][], `Result` (sum types) etc.

Thanks to **apoelstra** and others in the [rust community][rust] IRC
channel, I'm making pretty good progress.  The API isn't stable yet;
testing continues to turn up issues at a pretty high rate. But it's
getting there.

Open source collaboration and QA tools are great these days. Not only do
we have [rust-sqlite3 on github][vcs], but every time I push there:

  - [rust-sqlite3 on travis-ci][ci] runs all the tests and builds the
    docs an pushes them to
  - [rust-sqlite3 on rust-ci][docs], where docs are published.
