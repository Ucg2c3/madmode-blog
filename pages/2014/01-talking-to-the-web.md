Text chat is wonderfully near-real-time: you can think out loud and
somebody might respond right away or quite a while later or not at
all.

I'm usually in the #swig IRC channel when I'm hacking, and [this
nugget][2] from Dave Beckett hit the nail on the head:

    <DanC>	lots about mouse clicks and files and folders. sigh. I think folks want TOC items like: instant messagining, email, and web browsing. maybe photo editing, CD ripping
    <DanC>	"Configuring a CD Database" is under "9. Using Preference Tools"
    <DanC>	er... wha? how do I actually see the documents that these search results refer to? http://gnomedesktop.org/search/node/keyring
    <DanC>	oh... wierd... the headlines are invisible
    <Ontogon_>	dan, are you talking to yourself?
    <dajobe>	he's talking to the web
