<strong>talking to ssh-agent from python: throw me a bone?</strong>

<p> <p> <p> <p> <p>Hmm...
<a href="http://dm93.org/z2001/ConfidentialityVersusAvailability">ConfidentialityVersusAvailability</a>...
I'd like to talk to ssh-agent from various python hacks (perhaps <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm">cwm</a> tweaks, or browser plug-ins, screensaver connections... hmm...). There...
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/util/sshAuth.py">sshAuth.py</a> communicates with ssh-agent... but... hmm... I can't verify the signature using the <a href="http://www.amk.ca/python/writing/pycrypt/pycrypt.html">python cryptography toolkit</a>.

<p> <p> <p> <p> <p> I tried posting to <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=openssh-unix-dev&r=1&w=2">openssh-unix-dev@mindrot.org</a> and <a href="http://listserv.surfnet.nl/archives/python-crypto.html">PYTHON-CRYPTO@NIC.SURFNET.NL</a> but I guess you have to
subscribe to post to those, and I don't think I'm up to
that. I got one reply from amk asking a clarifying
question, but he hasn't found time
to reply in substance.

<p> <p> <p> <p> <p> Anybody wanna throw me a bone?
