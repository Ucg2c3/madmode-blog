<strong>If I had a rocket launcher...</strong>

<p> I spent the better part of last week fighting Sobig.F (well, looking over the virtual shoulder of the W3C systems guys as they fought it.) Forged mail interacts <em>very</em> badly with
the <a href="http://cr.yp.to/im/responsibility.html">first law of SMTP</a>: thou shalt deliver mail or bounce it.
Let's get <a href="http://spf.pobox.com/">SMTP+SPF</a>
or RMX or something like that out there... soon!

<p> But here's what really pissed me off: after several long days and nights switching MTAs from sendmail to postfix to get the Sobig garbage blocked before it entered the queue, when the stormcloud/queues on our mail hub and list hub were finally clearing, the load on the end-user mail server spiked because it had to <em>filter out all the rest of the filthy spam</em> that was still coming in. <b>ARGH!</b>


<p> <p> <strong>Saying thanks in the gift culture</strong>

<p> <p> Hmm... <a href="http://www.affero.com/ca/freenode">Affero</a>... i.e. if you like the help I gave you, you donate to the causes I support (in my name; i.e. I get the tax credit, not you, if I understand correctly). Nifty idea... I've offered money to people who gave me support in #debian and the like, and they refused; it's just not part of the culture. And I wrote a friggin check to SPI, and they haven't cashed it 8 months later. But I could see how this would work.
