<b>holy price-wars, batman! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000A0AZC/danconnollyA/103-0593844-6456613">color sidekick for $20 at amazon!</a></b>


<p> <p> It's my <a href="http://dm93.org/z2001/WearableGizmo">WearableGizmo</a> of choice. t-mobile provides <b>flat-rate data</b>. Crunch all you want. Hiptop google rocks. Real POP/SMTP email. The recent update even supports IMAP! and ssh! The instant messaging support can be really handy; it's AIM, which kinda sucks, but I gateway it to IRC pretty effectively (it's a trivial hack based on twisted python; if I get around to enhancing it to be non-trivial and factoring the passwords out, I'll make the code available).

<p> <p> My <a href="http://www.boutell.com/birthday.cgi/12/9">birthday is tuesday</a>; buy one for yourself and send me an amazon affiliate kick-back as a gift!

<p> <p> various terms and conditions apply: This price is after rebate, of course. $35 activation fee, maybe a 1-year contract, etc.

<p> <p> but I'm confident you'll like the thing for a year.

<p> <p> Speaking of <b>gift giving</b>...
if you're feeling generous, take a look at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/registry.html/ref=wlhu-goto-registry/103-0593844-6456613?id=26CB7SHNP1EWX">my amazon wishlist</a>. one click ordering! ;-)

<p> <p> hmm... thinking about an article on saying thanks in the gift culture.


<p> <b>see you at XML 2003?</b>

<p> I'll be there at the W3C TAG town hall
and the Practical RDF thingy. If you can't
be there, I'll be
<a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/ConnectingAudiences">taking notes in IRC and weblogs and such</a>. Gotta remember
to get my PGP gear ready. One for my travel checklist.

<p> <b>In praise of <a href="http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?searchon=names&subword=1&version=any&release=all&keywords=gnumeric">gnumeric</a></b>

<p> <a href="/person/MichaelCrawford/">MichaelCrawford</a>, do try it. I use it to send travel expense
reports every month; it interoperates with the .xls
world plenty well for my tastes. I was using it to visualize
the disk space on my machine just the other day, when
learning about <a href="/proj/LVM/">LVM</a>.

<p> <b>conversing accross communities and such</b>

<p> <p> Umm... I'm new to this business of conversing accross
advogato diaries... will MichaelCrawford get some form of notification that I linked to him from my diary?

<p> <p> started this item <a href="http://rdfig.xmlhack.com/2003/12/06/2003-12-06.html#1070734032.150950">in rdfig</a>. hmm... <b>gateway</b> my rdfig items here? selected ones?
&lt;/b&gt;

<p> <p> Hmm... composing articles in HTML source in a browser form sucks... er... itches... gotta scratch it with some code. This is worse than wiki (a pretty tolerable
form of <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/PoorMansHypertext">poor mans hypertext</a>. Anybody got advogato integrated with emacs so I could use James Clark's awesome <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/09/18/NXML">nxml-mode</a>?
Let's keep working toward <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/ImmersiveHypertextEditing">immersive hypertext editing</a>, OK mozilla and evolution folks?
