Got a firewire enclosure today so I can put this new 200GB disk drive in my iMac. As is <a href="http://dm93.org/z2001/UPACode">my custom</a>, I made
note of their UPC codes (after discovering, much to my delight, that my cuecat works thru the ps/2 port even while my keyboard is hooked up thru USB).

<p> I'd really like to see more open source/linux/debian support stuff indexed by UPC code. I'd like to be able to do <tt>apt-cache search <i>NNNNN</i></tt> and see debian packages that support the piece of hardware show up. Or something like that.
