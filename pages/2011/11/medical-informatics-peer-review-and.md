title: Medical Informatics, Peer Review, and Open Access
updated: 2011-11-21


Three issues of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_the_American_Medical_Informatics_Association">JAMIA</a> just arrived, weighing not just on my desk but also on my mind: success is defined by my peers in my new field, medical informatics, as publication in a journal where the readers have to pay for access. After fifteen years as an Open Web advocate, this grates on me.<br />
<br />
But I see that change is already underway. While JAMIA is the top journal that I hear about in the office so far, a quick trip to Wikipedia shows that it's second in impact to an open-access journal: <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_Medical_Internet_Research">Journal of Medical Internet Research</a>.</i>
