I find politics so distasteful that I rarely get directly involved, but on June 4, after I watched <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Job_(film)">Inside Job</a>, </i>I felt compelled to exercise my right to petition government for redress of grievances. I wrote the following to my elected representatives, <a href="http://fairelectionsnow.org/jerry-moran?goal=7718">Moran</a> and <a href="http://www.opencongress.org/people/show/300083_Pat_Roberts">Roberts</a>, via<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse;">&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-s750/show" style="border-collapse: collapse; color: #0000cc; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;" target="_blank">opencongress</a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: collapse;">:</span></span></div>
<blockquote style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">
Representative democracy in America has clearly been corrupted by big-money interests.<br /><br />The Fair Elections Now Act S.750 and the The Voters First Pledge look like reasonable steps, to me.<br /><br />I don't see you among <a href="http://fairelectionsnow.org/progress/7718/candidate/by-state/KS">the supporters</a>.<br /><br />Please sign the pledge, or at least explain to me your position on the bill.<br /><br />Thanks for your consideration and your service to our country.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Daniel W.

I got automated acknowledgement of receipt from both of their offices, but no response since. I don't expect more than a form letter. How long does it take to send one of those? Over a month, evidently.<br />
<br />
Sigh.<br />
