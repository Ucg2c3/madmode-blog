<p>Have I tried this gnome blog thing before?<p>
hmm... no blockquote? lame.<p>
what about images/photos?<p>
tried <a href="http://blogtk.sourceforge.net/blog/">BloGTK</a>; couldn't get it connected to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/">W3C Q&amp;A blog</a>.<p>
I think the last blog editor I enjoyed was flock; maybe I'll give that another try.
