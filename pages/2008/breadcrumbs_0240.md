title: 'The details of data in documents; GRDDL, profiles, and HTML5'

GRDDL, a mechanism for putting RDF data in XML/XHTML documents, is specified mostly at the XPath data model level. Some GRDDL software goes beyond XML and supports <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/HTMLAsSheAreSpoke">HTML as she are spoke</a>, aka tag soup. HTML 5 is intended to standardize the connection between tag soup and XPath. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/grddl-scenarios/#html_tidy_use_case">tidy use case</a> for GRDDL anticipates that using HTML 5 concrete syntax rather than XHTML 1.x concrete syntax involves no changes at the XPath level<br /><br />But in <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-grddl-comments/2008JulSep/0003.html">GRDDL and HTML5</a>, Ian Hickson, editor of HTML 5, advocates dropping the profile attribute of the HTML head element in favor of rel=&quot;profile&quot; or some such. I dropped by the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/irc">#microformats channel</a> to think out loud about this stuff, and Tantek said similarly, &quot;we may solve this with <strong>rel=&quot;profile&quot;</strong> anyway.&quot; The <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-profile">rel-profile</a> topic in the microformats wiki shows the idea goes pretty far back.<br /><br />Possibilities I see include:<br /><ul><li>GRDDL implementors add support for rel=&quot;profile&quot; along with HTML 5 concrete syntax</li><li>GRDDL implementors don&#39;t change their code, so people who want to use GRDDL with HTML 5 features such as &lt;video&gt; stick to XML-wf-happy HTML 5 syntax and they use the head/@profile attribute anyway, despite what the HTML 5 spec says.</li><li>People who want to use GRDDL stick to XHTML 1.x.</li><li>People who want to put data in their HTML documents use <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/RDFa">RDFa</a>. </li></ul><p>I don&#39;t particularly care for the rel=&quot;profile&quot; design, but one should choose ones battles and I&#39;m not inclined to choose this one. I&#39;m content for the market to choose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
