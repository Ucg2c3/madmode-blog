A quote from Gruber, via <a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/MIS.2009.36">Norvig</a>&nbsp;in 2009, on the sociology of developing ontologies:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
In some domains, competing factions each want to promote their own ontology. In other domains, the entrenched leaders of the field oppose any ontology because it would level the playing&nbsp;field for their competitors. This is&nbsp;a problem in diplomacy, not technology. As Tom Gruber says, “Every ontology is a treaty—a social&nbsp;agreement—among people with&nbsp;some common motive in sharing.”<sup>13</sup> When a motive for sharing is lacking, so are common ontologies.</blockquote>

Reminds me of the <a href="http://www2006.org/programme/item.php?id=panel01">WWW2006 panel on tagging vs the Semantic Web</a>, where I acknowledged that symbolic methods are no match for statistical methods when it comes to natural language processing and a lot of other tasks, I don't want computation of my bank balance crowd-sourced.<br />

Medicine has a long tradition of <a href="http://informatics.kumc.edu/work/wiki/MedicalTerminologyMarketplace">controlled vocabularies</a>, but they originate from billing systems. I suppose they have a role in evidence-based medicine, but that role isn't entirely clear to me yet. I'm pretty new to the field.<br />
