title: Saying Goodbye to Moore Method math notes and Robert Miner
updated: 2012-02-22


I'm purging another box of files today: college math &amp; C.S. notes, including a few dozen transparencies I prepared for classes on Topology and Fractals that Dr. Starbird and Dr. Cline taught using the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_method">Moore method</a>:<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Instead of using a textbook, the students are given a list of definitions and theorems which they are to prove and present in class ...<br />
After Moore became an associate-professor at University of Texas at Austin in 1920, the Moore method began to gain popularity. Today, the University of Texas at Austin remains a strong advocate of the method and uses it in various courses within their mathematics department ...</blockquote>

Metric spaces, hausdorf spaces, cauchy sequences, attractors... I'm sure glad for Wikipedia, because I can hardly follow my own notes; most of it has leaked out.<br />
<br />
I thought about capturing one or two formulas for posterity, which reminded me to try <a href="http://webdemo.visionobjects.com/equation.html?locale=default">Web Equasion</a>, which, amazingly, does handwriting recognition of LaTeX using JavaScript. (hat tip: <a href="https://twitter.com/therealmaxf">@therealmaxf</a>). I couldn't quite get it to completely recognize a 1-to-infinity sub/superscript notation, but I noticed the nicely typeset output was rendered with something I didn't recognize: <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>. Cool! "an open source JavaScript display engine for mathmatics that works in all modern browsers." So I started looking into it...<br />
<br />
... which is when I got the <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/2011/12/06/news/a-sad-day/">sad news about Robert Miner</a>, who was co-chair of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">Math Working Group</a>, along with Patrick Ion for much of the time I was at W3C. I didn't work with him extensively, but the Math Working Group was always a class act.<br />
