title: 'OLIAS Web Index, circa 1994'
summary: '"The best way to find information since the card catalog"'

In preparation for the 1994 Seybold Seminar, a few months after Mark
Gaither and I wrapped James Clark's SGML parser in a CGI script to
create the first online [HTML markup validation service][svc], the
OLIAS team at [Hal Software Systems][halsoft] put together an _Index
to the World Wide Web_:

OLIAS was state-of-the-art for electronic publishing, at the time:

Presuming license to re-publish for the purpose of historical preservation,
I ripped a copy and put it online:

The index format is highly optimized for minimal seeking on a CD,
and hence incomprehensible without running OLIAS itself:

> The OLIAS Web Index demonstration software supports one client and two server configurations. The client configuration requires a Sun SPARC workstation running SunOS 4.1.x (Solaris 1.1.1), up to 350MB of disk space, and either X11R5 or Open Windows. The server configurations can be a machine on the client system's LAN that is connected to the Internet and running either a SOCKS server or a Web proxy server process.

Getting it running would be a retrocomputing exercise for
another day, though I did get as far as finding
