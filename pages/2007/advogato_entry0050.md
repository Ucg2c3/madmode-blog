fugues</strong>

<p> I got
<cite><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptonomicon">Cryptonomicon</a></cite>
for Christmas; chalk one up for Amazon wish-lists. It
walks the line between geek culture and popular culture
in a way that makes me want people close to me to read it so
they'll understand me a little better. 
This bit
from p. 819
struck a chord...

<p> <blockquote>
<p>"Who framed me, then?" Randy asks, kind of rhetorically.
He was just in the middle of doing some pretty cool C++
coding when he got yanked out of his cell to have this
surprise encounter with the Dentist, and is surprising
himself with just how bored and irritated he is. He has
reverted, in other words, back into a pure balls-to-the-wall
nerdisim rivaled only by his early game-coding days back in
Seattle. The sheer depth and involution of the current
nerdism binge would be hard to convey to anyone.
<strong>Intellectually, he is juggling half a dozen lit torches,
Ming vases, live puppies, and running chainsaws.</strong> In
this
frame of mind he cannot bring himself to give a shit about
the fact that this incredibly powerful billionaire has gone
to a lot of trouble to come and F2F with him. And so he asks
the above question as nothing more than a perfunctory
guesture, the subtext being <em>I wish you would go away but
minimal standards of social decency dictate that I should
say something.</em>
