title: 'The Mercurial SCM: great for lots of stuff, but not the holy grail'

<p>I have been tracking the <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">mercurial</a> project for a couple years now. First just a bookmark under <a href="http://del.icio.us/connolly/python+scm">python+scm</a>, then after <a href="/breadcrumbs/node/96">using hg to code on an airplane</a> about a year later, I was hooked. I helped get the <a href="/breadcrumbs/node/127">microformats testing effort using mercurial</a> about a year later, and did some noodling on <cite><a href="/breadcrumbs/node/129">Access control and version control: an over-constrained problem?</a></cite> around that same time.</p><p>Yesterday I played host to Matt Mackall as he gave a presentation,  <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/w3c-talk/">The Mercurial     SCM</a>, to the W3C Team. In the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/03/22-hg-talk-minutes">disucssion that followed</a>, we touched on:</p><ul><li>  fractal project organization (touching on <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/PartialClone">PartiaClone</a> and the <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/ForestExtension">ForestExtension</a>) </li><li>the toplogy of update flows in a large development system with<br />         overlapping communities with differentt access rights</li> <li>comparisons with Darcs</li> <li>hg hosting, large projects, user support </li></ul><p> It seems that hg scales to very large projects, as long as they&#39;re fairly uniform, but it doesn&#39;t support the sort of tangly fractal web of inter-project dependencies that would make it the holy grail of version control systems. </p>
