<b class="title">Music Collections and Office Organization</b>

<p> It worked this time. I wonder why.

<p> I have been trying to rip Paul Simon's
<cite><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graceland_%28album%29">Graceland</a></cite>
using debian stuff for years. I was
sure the CD was
mangled beyond recognition, but soundjuicer on Ubuntu on
this new
HP pavilion just gave me a bunch of .flac files that sound fine.

<p> I listened to this album all summer as I wrote <a
href="http://dm93.org/z2001/HyperSchool">80,000 lines of
HyperTalk code</a>
back in 1989. I think my copy was on tape at the time.

<p> I wonder if the CD I ripped today is the same on I failed to
rip so many times earlier or if this is a different CD.

<p> This task is in my queue today because the music shelf in my
office is poorly organized and overfull, and when I took my
worship music binder off the shelf, this CD fell off the
shelf. Rather than put it back on the shelf last night, I
put it in my "in" box, GTD-style.

<p> This wakes up all sorts of long-swapped-out jobs involving
organizing my multimedia collection.

<p> Mostly I don't do back-ups; I just send email and check
stuff in using source code control (CVS for ages, but more
recently hg... that's another story [@@delicious scm
bookmarks]...). And I use google to find it again.
But I don't have license to redistribute these flac files,
so I have to manage them myself.

<p> Part of me says: don't bother. If I'm going to fill my iPod
(shuffle) with things to fill my head, they should be things
that
glorify God, and while Paul Simon's music is nothing nasty,
I'm not sure it glorifies God. Plus, the whole recorded music
oligarchy is an unstable marketplace just waiting for a
revolution.
"If you're whining about iTunes DRM, you're part of the
problem," said a slashdot commentor that hit home for me.
(@@todo: look it up and link it) much like a conversation
with AaronSw
about how songs and musicians have been around for a long
time, even before you could get rich selling records; if the
bottom falls out of the recorded music industry, humanity
will go on.

<p> <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrains</a> solves the
shared metadata problem for CDs 
pretty well, but Rhythmbox doesn't seem to automatically
link to it like it used to. It does show album cover art...

<p> In trying to figure out why, I looked in the help menu which
led me to launchpad which links to IRC
channels; those <a
href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/UriSchemes/irc">irc: links</a>
Just Work in Ubuntu. Yay! Except that xchat didn't realize
that I was already logged into the Freenode network. Odd.

<p> Better get back to other things... everything is so
intertwingled I could go on and on...
