Package management is a blessing when there&rsquo;s integrated QA
and support. apt-get is only one half of the equation; the
Debian Bug Tracking system (and the people behind it) is
the other.

<p> Case in point: fink adds apt-get to the Mac OS, but the
result is that updates from Apple and updates from fink
compete/collide, and when there&rsquo;s a problem, the natural
result is finger-pointing rather than integrated QA.

<p> Debian/ubuntu have scaled amazingly well, but they rely on
quite a bit of trust. The MS Windows marketplace includes
lots of mutually distrustful players, as does the Mac OS X
marketplace. It&rsquo;s not at all clear how apt-get and the
debian bug tracking system (or ubuntu&rsquo;s launchpad) can scale
to support that sort of marketplace.
