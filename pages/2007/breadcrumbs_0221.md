<p>I have a new bookmark. No, not a del.icio.us bookmark; not some bits in a file. This is the kind you have to go there to get.. go to <a href="http://dannyayers.com/2007/12/05/tragedy-in-cleveland">Cleveland</a>, that is. It reads:</p> <blockquote> <p>Thank you<br />for you love &amp; support<br />for the Ikpia &amp; Ogbuji families<br />At this time of real need.<br />We will never forget<br /><strong>Imose, Chica, &amp; Anya</strong></p><p><img src="http://thekingdomkids.org/images/all_kkids_cropped.jpg" alt="Imose, Chica, &amp; Anya" title="Imose, Chica, &amp; Anya" width="351" height="312" /> </p><p><a href="http://www.aliconline.org/">Abundant Life International Church</a><br />Highland heights, OH</p> </blockquote> <p>After working with Chime for a year or so on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/g/data-view">GRDDL</a> Working Group (he was the difference between a hodge-podge of test files and a nicely organized <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/grddl-tests/">GRDDL Test Cases</a> technical report), I was really excited to meet him at the W3C Technical Plenary in Cambridge in early November. His <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-dlp/wiki/FuXi">Fuxi</a> work is one of the best implementations of the way I think <a href="/breadcrumbs/taxonomy/term/30">semantic web rules and proofs</a> should go. When he told me some people didn&#39;t see the practical applications, it made me want to fly there and tell them how I think this will save lives and <a href="http://www.data.org/">end world hunger</a>. </p><p>So this past Tuesday, when I read <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/cuyahoga/119658854495020.xml&amp;coll=2&amp;thispage=1">the news about his family</a>, the only way I could make my peace with it was to go and be with him. I can only imagine what he is going through. <a href="http://zepheira.com/team/">Eric Miller and Brian and David</a> drove me to the funeral, but the line to say hi to the family was too long. And the internment service didn&#39;t really provide an opportunity to talk. So I was really glad that after I filled my plate at the reception, a seat across from Chime and Roschelle opened up for me and I got to sit and share a meal with them.</p><p>Grandpa Linus was at the table, too. His eulogy earlier at the funeral ended with the most inspiring spoken rendition of a <a href="http://www.chordie.com/chord.pere/www.roughstock.com/cowpie/cowpie-songs/a/autry_gene/vaya_con_dios.crd">song </a> that I have ever heard:</p> <blockquote> <p> Now The     Hacienda&#39;s Dark The Town Is     Sleeping<br /> Now The     Time Has Come To Part     The Time For     Weeping<br /> Vaya Con Dios My     Darling<br /> Vaya Con Dios My     Love</p> </blockquote>  <p>His eulogy is also posted as <cite>Grandparents&#39; lament</cite> on <a href="http://thekingdomkids.org/">The Kingdom Kids</a> web site, along with <a href="http://thekingdomkids.org/fund/">details about a fund</a> to help the family get back on their feet. </p>
