<p>We&#39;re long overdue for standard URIs for units of measure in the Semantic Web.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.ontologyportal.org/">SUMO stuff</a> has a nice browser (e.g. see <a href="http://sigma.ontologyportal.org:4010/sigma/Browse.jsp?kb=SUMO&amp;term=Meter">meter</a>), a nice mapping from wordnet, and nice licensing terms. Of course, it&#39;s not RDF-native. In particular, it uses n-ary relations in the form of functions of more than one argument; 1 hour is written <strong>(&amp;%MeasureFn 1 &amp;%HourDuration)</strong>. I might be willing to work out a mapping for that, but other details in <a href="http://sigmakee.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/sigmakee/KBs/Merge.kif">the KIF source</a> bother me a bit: a month is modelled conservatively as something between 28 and 31 days, but a year is exactly 365 days, despite leap-years. Go figure.</p>  <p>There&#39;s a nice <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mathml-units/">Units in MathML</a></cite> note from November 2003, but all the URIs are incomplete, e.g. <strong>http://.../units/yard</strong> .</p>  <p>The Sep 2006 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/">OWL Time</a> Working Draft has full URIs such as <strong>http://www.w3.org/2006/time#seconds</strong>, but its approach to n-ary relations is unsound, as I pointed out in a <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swbp-wg/2006Jun/0035">Jun 2006 comment</a>.</p>  <p>Tim sketched the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/InterpretationProperties">Interpretation Properties</a>  idiom back in 1998; I don&#39;t suppose it fits in OWL-DL, but it appeals to me quite a bit as an approach to units of measure. He just recently fleshed out some details in <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/unit">http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/unit</a>. Units of measure are modelled as properties that relate quantities to magnitudes; for example:</p><pre> track length [ un:mile 0.25].</pre> <p>This Interpretation Properties approach allows us to model composition of units in the natural way:</p><pre>W is o2:chain of (A V).<br /></pre><p>where o2:chain is like property chaining in OWL 1.1 (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-owl-dev/2007JulSep/0037.html">we hope</a>).</p><p>Likewise, inverse units are modelled as inverse properties: </p> <pre>s a Unit; rdfs:label &quot;s&quot;.<br />hz rdfs:label &quot;Hz&quot;; owl:inverseOf s. </pre>  <p>Finally, scalar conversions are modelled using <strong>product</strong>; for example, <strong>mile</strong> is defined in terms of meter like so:</p><pre>(m 0.0254) product inch.<br />(inch 12) product foot.<br />(foot 3) product yard.<br />(yard 22) product chain.<br />(chain 10) product furlong.<br />(furlong 8)product mile.</pre>   <p>I supplemented his ontology with some test/example cases, <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/unit_ex.n3">unit_ex.n3</a> and then added a few rules to flesh out the modelling. These rules converts between meters and miles:</p><pre># numeric multiplication associates with unit multiplication<br />{ (?U1 ?S1) un:product ?U2.<br />  (?U2 ?S2) un:product ?U3.<br />  (?S1 ?S2) math:product ?S3<br />} =&gt; { (?U1 ?S3) un:product ?U3 }<br /><br /># scalar conversions between units<br />{ ?X ?UNIT ?V.<br />  (?BASE ?CONVERSION) un:product ?UNIT.<br />  (?V ?CONVERSION) math:product ?V2.<br />} =&gt; { ?X ?BASE ?V2 }.</pre><p>Put them together and out comes:</p><pre>    ex:track     ex:length  [<br />             :chain 20.0;<br />             :foot 1320.0;<br />             :furlong 2.0;<br />             :inch 15840.0;<br />             :m 402.336;<br />             :mile 0.25;<br />             :yard 440.0 ] .</pre><p>The rules I wrote for pushing conversion factors into chains isn&#39;t fully general, but it works in cases like converting from this:</p><pre>(un:foot un:hz) o2:chain fps.<br />bullet speed [ fps 4000 ].</pre><p>to this:<br /> </p><pre>    ex:bullet     ex:speed  [<br />             ex:fps 4000;<br />             :mps 1219.2 ] .</pre><p> As I say, I find this approach quite appealing. I hope to discuss it with people working on units of measure in development of a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/uwa/editors-drafts/DeliveryContextOntology/2007-05-31/DCOntology.html">Delivery Context Ontology</a>. </p>
