Finally released
<a href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2001/palmagent/aimbridge.py?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">aimbridge.py</a>, a gateway between AIM and IRC after factoring the passwords out of it a few days ago (<a href="http://rdfig.xmlhack.com/2004/01/03/2004-01-03.html#1073171395.356661">3Jan rdfig entry</a>). Now supports the basic /server, /join, and /part and a few other goodies...

<p> <p> It's based on <a href="http://www.twistedmatrix.com/">twisted</a>; after <a href="http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/chatlogs/rdfig/2004-01-04.html#T01-42-46">puzzling over the twisted python APIs a bit</a>, I like its architecture and design even more. Deferreds are like promises in ... hmm... scheme? E? one of those languages... Nice alternative to locking and threads.

<p> <p> I wrote this thing because my <a href="http://dm93.org/z2001/WearableGizmo">WearableGizmo</a>, a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000A0AZC/danconnollyA/">t-mobile/danger sidekick</a>, has very handy IM support, but it's AOL, and the rest of my peers use IRC.

<p> <p> As an example, I was out of the office going to the <a href="http://www.1856.com/">Steamboat Arabia museum</a> with family Friday, but I kept my gizmo tuned into one of the channels from work. There's a meeting coming up 22 Jan, and somebody said they'd found a cheap flight, as long as I booked it that day. Using the gizmo's IM and email support, I was able to negotiate the itinerary with our travel support folks in the spare moments at the museum. Nifty!
