<b>Using XSLT to get from XHTML to LaTeX</b>

<p> The ISWC2004 deadline got extended by a couple weeks
just as one of TimBL's <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/">design issues articles</a> was looking like it might make a good paper.
When I saw that the 
<a href="http://iswc2004.semanticweb.org/submission/authors_instruction.php">submission instructions</a> required a certain form of LaTeX,
I couldn't help automating the conversion from XHTML using my favorite hammer, XSLT.

<p> The result not only scratched my itch but evoked some "gimme!" responses from a few of my peers.

<p> So here you go: <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/04/xhlt91/">Transforming XHTML to LaTeX and BibTeX</a>.

<p> It was good to see everybody at WWW2004 in New York.
Thanks to edd, dajobe, and various people with IRC
clients, we have
<a href="http://www2004.xmlhack.com/">community coverage</a>. Good thing, since I didn't manage
to stay for dev day.
