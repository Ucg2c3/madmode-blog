<b>bottles</b> is really starting to come together... to the point where I'd like to publish the code in the normal way so that I can show it to people. Hmm... gotta revive webtechs.com, I think.

<p> twisted and <a href="http://www.divmod.org/Home/Projects/Nevow/index.html">nevow </a> are working really well, along with sqlite, mx.DateTime, and, of course, python.

<p> <b>Broken CSS support</b> on safari sucks, meanwhile. Or maybe <a href="http://www.allmyfaqs.com/faq.pl?Center_with_CSSI">these centering tricks</a> are abusing <tt>display: table</tt>. I haven't checked the specs in detail yet.

<p> I bit the bullet today and explored <b>deployment on Windows</b>. Boy was I surprised! All these dev tools have easy-to-use windows installers. Open Source rocks!
