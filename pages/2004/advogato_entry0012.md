<p>I'm developing an interesting relationship with my chiropractor... Dr. M is <em>my</em> customer sometimes. The first time, I helped him recover his data when part of his disk went bad. I thought it was going to be as simple as mounting the VFAT partition under linux, but it wasn't... the disk was bad in some really strange way... I had to copy the raw partition to another machine before I could mount it.

<p> <p> <p>The next project is...

<p> <p> <p> <b>bottles</b>

<p> <p> <p>This is <b>database application</b>; I think of it as a COBOL program; I wrote database apps in COBOL in high school. All the programs had add, change, and delete screens.

<p> <p> <p> <p>This is a product development project, not a research project. <b>A program is something that works for the developer; a product works for the customer.</b> I haven't done product development in ages.

<p> <p> <p> <p>I have a friend that does PC tech support and occasional database development. I thought maybe a MS Access thing would be more "normal" for the customer and I was getting ready to let my friend take over the project. But then he told me that <b>deploying MS Access apps is too hard</b>.
I didn't need convincing!
So we're still thinking about how to work together.

<p> <p> <p> <p>Now I'm putting together something with <b><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">sqlite</a></b> and <b><a href="http://twisted.sourceforge.net/TwistedDocs-1.2.0/howto/enterprise.html">twisted python's DB stuff</a></b>. It's fun!

<p> <p> <p> <p>I did the database design <b><a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/g/data-view">GRDDL</a></b>-style: wrote it in XHTML with Amaya, converted it to RDF/OWL with XSLT, and converted the OWL to SQL with some more XSLT.

<p> <p> <p> <p> <p><em>Where's the source</em>, you ask?

<p> <p> <p> <p>Dr. M wants to sell this thing to his peers, so I'm <b>noodling on the license</b>. Maybe dual license? Or just charge for support? And it's not really a w3.org thing... and I'm not sure I want to use <a href="http://dm93.org/">my family website</a> for
product devleopment. Hmm... maybe <a href="http://www.webtechs.com/">webtechs</a>?

<p> <p> <p> <p>Meanwhile, I'm trying out <a href="/proj/subversion/">subversion</a>. The docs are pretty good, so far...
