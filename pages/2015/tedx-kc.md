Looking back over the year, one of the highlights was [TEDxKC][TKC].  In
its seventh year, Kansas City's TEDx is the largest in the country. It
lived up to the hype. The Kauffman Center is a great venue, we went
with some good friends, and the program was excellent.

The most inspiring speakers were:

 - [Tommy Caldwell - What are you up against?][TC]
 - [Martin Pistorius - My Way Back to Words][MP]

[MP]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WD1IX1AFRZg

Both of them conveyed extremes of the human condition, but Pistorius
was simply spell-binding.

[The Yawpers jam][Y] was mindless fun. The Kauffman Center is a
naturally high-brow scene, so when the front man opened with "I'm
gonna play some really stupid rock 'n roll for you," and the drummer
started banging away, it was good to get outside your head and roll
with it.

Speaking of fun, at one of the booths, I got my own [google cardboard][gc]
viewer, courtesy of Southwest Airlines.

Scott Hamilton was a name and a face we all knew from Olympic skating,
but he was there to talk about [Surviving the cancer cure][SC]. He was
promoting [proton therapy][pt], an alternative that the insurance
companies seem to be resisting without good cause, given the falling
costs and the quality of outcomes. Currently there are 14 operating
proton therapy centers throughout the U.S. with another 10 under
construction. The news that there's also a proton therapy center
slated for Kansas City got a big round of applause.

The local challenge winner was
[Audrey Odom - Fighting drug resistant infections with your breath][AO].
The increasing resistance to antibiotics is pretty serious stuff, so
her simple diagnostic tool looks pretty important.

And after all that, there's an after-party on the lawn, and all the
speakers join in. Next time, we'll know to plan to stay for more
than just a few minutes of that!
