I'm back from the [RChain][] Governance Forum in Seattle, which was
full of big dreams, just like the first Web conference in Geneva.

I went in with almost no idea what that means. But at the closing
brunch, I found myself telling the next person at the table that the
economics of email—the original decentralized Internet communication
platform—was what led me to trade my privacy to Google for spam
protection.

Many of us who built the Web had in mind a decentralized system where
access to information and freedom of expression would enrich our lives.
At some level, we knew sharp tools cut both ways, but ...

The result is a vulnerability that Kate Charlet, who worked on Cyber
Policy in the U.S. Department of Defense for the last decade, [says][KC18]
nation states have successfully used to destabilize our democracy.

Perhaps there's something to all this blockchain stuff; perhaps we can
repair the imbalance by integrating economics into the next generation
network architecture.

The imbalance in the system has a glib description:

> If you are not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the
> product being sold. -- [blue_beetle Aug 2010][bb10]

But another way to put it is:

> There's a strangle-hold on social media today; people don't get a
> chance to participate in the economic proposition in an equitable
> way. -- [Greg Meredith, Jan 2017][LGM1701]

He emphasizes that we need new ways of coordinating, inspired by
resilient living systems and reflective intelligence. Tai Chi on
Saturday morning was a whole body experience of it.

And music!

I had great conversations with Peter and Jonathan and Derek and Rudy,
including Ted Nelson's ideas on the [evolution of movie making][TN].

Greg performed in a group of mind-bogglingly improvisational guitar
players. Mostly I felt stressed and out of place when listening to it.
But I was right at home when the twelve bar blues chord progression
emerged in the middle of it.

I was also pretty much at home when I saw lightning talks on the
agenda, so I offered to lead the session.  That was [great
fun][ltvid]. I gave two talks myself and enjoyed a lot of the
follow-up discussions.

The technical architecture of RChain also sunk in a bit more.
In addition to [capability security and namespaces][rchain1], I'm beginning
to see reflection (the R in RChain) as a possible solution
to the [quoting and diagonalization issues][CWM1601] TimBL and I struggled
with in the Semantic Web.
