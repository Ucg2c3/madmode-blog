<p>just got back from <a href="http://www.geekcruises.com/home/ll_home.html">linux lunacy</a>, the most recent geekcruise. What a blast!


<p> <p>
I started working on a <a href="http://dm93.org/2001/0110geekcruise/">photo journal</a>, but I'm not very happy with it yet.
Can't quite decide how I want to manage my
photo collection.
