## RChain Blues

I have had fun working with the RChain community,
but I am now to the point where I can't be party to
their business practices.

I am inclined to keep my distance until I see
  - some [details re Barcelona](https://github.com/rchain-community/sm19a/issues/14#issuecomment-495039918)
  - [timely board agendas and minutes](https://github.com/rchain-community/sm19a/issues/11)
  - the [board carry out IOB 4 member participation in governance](https://github.com/rchain-community/sm19a/issues/3)
  - quarterly financials on time
  - the coop [divest any significant interest in a proprietary software license](https://github.com/rchain-community/sm19a/issues/9#issuecomment-495452506). 

And I am standing by for...

The coop should divest any significant interest in a proprietary software license.
