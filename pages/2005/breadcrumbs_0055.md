Managing passwords via email callback is hampered by anti-spam mechanisms. I just helped a breadcrumbs user whose password message from drupal was classified as Junk by Mac OS X Mail.

Meanwhile, I did enough <a href="http://dm93.org/z2001/ConfidentialityVersusAvailability#msg20050219173305+0000@dm93.org">research on the Mac OS X keychain</a> to trust it. Support for OpenID in drupal is already in the <a href="http://www.lifewiki.net/openid/OpenIDWishlist">OpenID wish list</a> and I've see <a href="http://drupal.org/node/33254">some progress</a>.

It's not obvious to me how to connect the keychain to OpenID, but I'm sure there's a way. Any suggestions?
