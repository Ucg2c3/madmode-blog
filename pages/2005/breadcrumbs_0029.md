<p>Via Karen in the <a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/TAMI/">TAMI</a> project, I gather last month the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security announced the result of an XML collaboration - version 0.1 of the <a href="http://niem.gov/niem01.php">National Information Exchange Model (NIEM)</a> which will be used for law enforcement, emergency management, etc. communities and the parties who exchange information with them.</p>

<p>I hope to check it out. Better yet... I hope somebody else checks it out and writes a <abbr title="Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages"><a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/g/data-view">GRDDL</a></abbr> transformation.</p>
