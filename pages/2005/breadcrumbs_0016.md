In a <a href="http://www.policyawareweb.org/2005/ftf2/10-28-paw-minutes.html#item08">PAW project discussion of writing assignments</a> for WWW2006, KR, etc., I asked that we use XHTML rather than LaTeX to collaborate on the papers.

The WWW2006 deadline is too soon to make the transition, but I took the source of one of the papers in development and translated it to XHTML in order to test my <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/04/xhlt91/">Transforming XHTML to LaTeX and BibTeX</a></cite> tools. Since the tools have only been tested on one project, of course they needed some tweaks. And they'll need some more for figures.

But I'm hopeful that it'll be cost-effective to do things this way.

Meanwhile, there's a <a href="http://www.microformats.org/wiki/cite-formats">cite-formats</a> discussion in the microformat community. My work includes a microformat for bibliography stuff. I haven't figured out URIs for the properties nor converted it to RDF just yet, like I did for <a href="http://www.w3.org/Addressing/schemes">my old index of URI schemes</a> and like we did for <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/01/tr-automation/">automating publication of W3C tech reports</a>.
