title: 'Connecting DIG Student Projects to the MIT UROP listing'
published: True
tags: ['breadcrumbs']

<p>A couple MIT students have found their way to the <tt>#dig</tt>
channel and asked about UROPs during IAP. I'm still learning about
student rhythms at MIT; I was never a student here; I got my degree at
<a href="http://www.utexas.edu/">U.T. Austin</a>. My ten years
with W3C has exposed me to the terms <dfn>UROP</dfn> and <dfn>IAP</dfn> before, but I
have paged most of it out. Let's refresh our cache, shall we?

<blockquote>
<p>The Independent Activities Period (IAP) is a special four week term
at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the end of the
month. IAP 2006 takes place from January 9 through February 3.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://web.mit.edu/urop/dept/super/projpost.html">UROP
info for supervisors</a>, I see there's a <a
href="http://web.mit.edu/urop/dept/super/projpost.html#post">form</a>
for listing projects. Hey... it would be cool if the <a
href="/breadcrumbs/taxonomy/term/25">student projects</a> category
here in this blog were automatically syndicated via that form.
A meta-student-project?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we do have a few notes on student projects among our <a
href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2004/12/24-studentinfo.html">DIG info
for MIT students</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how items syndicated from Danny/Eric via
<a href="/breadcrumbs/node/20">the WordPress plug-in</a> can
get categorized; I suppose we can do it manually, after-the-fact?</p>

<p>I see a bunch of <a
href="http://web.mit.edu/urop/research/openings.html">UROP
openings</a> for this time of year. The <cite>Building Games to
Acquire Commonsense Knowledge</cite> project looks cool.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: It is expected that UROP students are
supervised in the laboratory at all times, per the Institute's "no
working alone" policy .</p>

<p>Sounds a bit like a "no coding alone" policy that I've been pushing
around W3C and DIG, since discovering the value of <a
href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html">pair
programming</a>, or a <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/AdvancedDevelopment">variant of it</a>.</p>
