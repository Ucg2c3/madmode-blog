title: 'xchat RFE: "mail a log of this chat to mbox@domain" macro'
published: True
tags: ['breadcrumbs']

I just finished a phone/IRC meeting. The norm is to have an email record of it. xchat automatically logs my channels. So I can go in with emacs, find the relevant log file, exctract today's episode, compose a mail message, and paste it in.

Can I make an xchat macro for that?

What's a good way to structure RFEs? How does Malone (the ubuntu/canonical/shuttleworth thing) do it? Lazyweb?

This could go on advogato too.
