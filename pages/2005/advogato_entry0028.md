It used to be that commercial or political spam was sent out by one type of miscreant, while worms and viruses were created and propagated by another type. These days, the two have merged. This is because spammers are using viruses to take control of thousands of people's computers, which the spammers then use to send out their crap. -- <a href="http://www.acme.com/mail_filtering/conclusions.html#same">2005 by Jef Poskanzer</a>
