title: 'Brought my hockey skates with me this time'

<p>A couple years ago, my flight to <abbr title="Boston Logan airport">BOS</abbr> for some meeting (the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/03/TechPlenAgenda.html">TP</a>?)
got me in at about 8:00 on a Tuesday night. I arrived with no plans for the evening, and couldn't scare up anything interesting to do. When I got to <a href="http://www.csail.mit.edu/">CSAIL</a>/<a href="http://web.mit.edu/buildings/statacenter/">stata</a> the next day, I found a flyer about <a href="http://hockey.csail.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Tuesday_Hockey_FAQ">csail hockey on Tuesdays</a>. Darn! If only I had known!</p>

<p>On another trip to BOS about a year later, I managed to get out on the ice with them. The format was great: there's one group that knows what they're doing (the "B/C line"), and another group that tries not to fall down too much (the "D line"). The B/C line goes out there for 2.5 minutes and then a whistle blows and they all clear the ice, and the D line (including me) fumbles around for a 2.5 minutes, and the cycle repeats. After an hour of that, I was totally exhausted.</p>

<p>I was using all borrowed equipment, and I think the skates didn't fit me well.</p>

<p>So this time, I brought my skates. Yes, that meant trusting the airline with checked baggage, something I haven't done for years.</p>

<p>This trip took me to Montreal for a big W3C membership meeting and then to CSAIL for a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">TAG</a> meeting. There's a rink in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000_de_La_Gaucheti%C3%A8re">1000 de La Gaucheti√®re</a> across the street from the meeting hotel, and I got in a couple hours on Saturday. Then during the TAG meeting lunch break on Tuesday, I did some <a href="http://web.mit.edu/athletics/www/skate.htm">skating at MIT Johnson ice rink</a>.</p>

That evening, I watched the
<a href="http://mitathletics.collegesports.com/sports/m-hockey/sched/mit-m-hockey-sched.html">MIT
      varsity hockey team</a> play a pretty exciting, high-scoring game; it ended in a 5-5 tie (see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dckc/tags/hockey/">mobolg photos</a>).</p>

<p>And finally, at 11pm Tuesday night, I played CSAIL pick-up hockey with my own skates. This time, there was no separation of D skaters from B/C skaters. I figured out that my main job was to get out of the way when they started skating real fast (I know from coaching little-league soccer what a waste it is for two attacking players to be taking the same lane). I think I made one or two useful defensive plays, and when the puck was passed to me a handful of times, I think I passed it to one of my team-mates more often than I gave it to the other guys.</p>

<p>Though I didn't feel as completely wiped out as last time, I did get a good work-out, and since the game ended around midnight and I got back to my hotel around 1am, that 7am alarm for my flight the next morning came pretty early.</p>
