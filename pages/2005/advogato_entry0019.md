<b>testing gnome blog</b>

<p> <p>My son is supposed to keep a reading response journal. I wonder about having him do it with a blog... maybe using livejournal's friends-only authentication stuff... or better: is there an easy-to-administer blog thingy for zope?

<p> <p>I keep bugging TimBL and EricM about blogging (esp with trackback and comments) too.

<p> <p>This posting got kinda mangled; the title got thrown away.

<p> <p>Hmm... hypertext UI? <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/">my home page</a> hmm... klunky dialog interface, but the resulting text is OK.<p>
Suppose I drag n drop from my web browser? Ugh. lose. Where's paste link when we need it? Hmm... recoverable... <a href="https://www.gnome.org/~seth/gnome-blog/">gnome blog</a>
