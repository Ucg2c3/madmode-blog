The drupal theme we're using is XHTML-happy, but doesn't know that <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/font-size">it's rude to change the font size of body text</a>. Anybody wanna clue me in on how to fix it? <em>update: seems somebody fixed it. I wonder how. It seems like all the fonts got bigger, not just the main body text.</em>
