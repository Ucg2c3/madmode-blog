Back from XML 2005 in Altanta, looking into a dist-upgrade, I hesitate to make <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/185">the switch to the x.org X server</a>, since I use an nvidia chip. Does the open source <a href="http://wiki.x.org/wiki/nv">nv</a> driver support 3d acceleration?
