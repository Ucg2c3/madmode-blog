The features of the systems that people build with PHP cannot be deined. We're pretty committed to drupal for this breadcrumbs blog.

I doubt I'll be doing much hacking on it, though. In part that's a good thing... hacking on your publishing infrastructure can be a real distraction. It's best to be a plain old customer some times.

But I can't get rid of the feeling that I'd rather we weren't using PHP. Neither PHP nor javascript meets the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-webarch-extlang-19980210#Ambiguity">unambiguity requirement</a> that I think is critical for software engineering in the large.

Hmm... repost some of my older entries? Or rewrite them as new entries here? Decisions, decisions.
