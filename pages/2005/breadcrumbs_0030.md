alt="Go-Kart medal ceremony" /></a> I'm writing to my brother about <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nicole_hugo/tags/gokarting+montreal/">go-karting in Montreal</a> last night, but OS X Mail editor doesn't grok hypertext. I'm tired of in-your-face URIs and <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/PoorMansHypertext">poor-man's hypertext</a>. The thunderbird editor groks hypertext but doesn't know that <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/IntegrityIsJobOne">integrity is job one</a>. I really should check that this bug is reported and report it if not, but I don't want to manage yet another bugzilla account. Oh for OpenID in bugzilla! I also want to make sure the lack of "treat this as plain text" in firefox is a reported bug.</p>
