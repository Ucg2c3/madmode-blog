I recently took a turn leading discussion in the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/~6.898/">Notions &amp; Notations class</a>; I presented <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Talks/1020swl/">Issues in Semantic Web Logic</a></cite>, a hasty set of slides based on one of TimBL&#39;s DesignIssues notes, <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Logic">The Semantic Web as a language of logic</a></cite>.  I expected that the idea of dropping the law of excluded middle in order to deal with  self-reference paradoxes (liar&#39;s paradox, Russel&#39;s paradox, ...) would be controversial. It wasn&#39;t at all, to this audience. Hmm...  See also: <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/LogicalReflection">LogicalReflection</a> wiki topic.
