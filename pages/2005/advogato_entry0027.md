The --xml-output option on <a href="http://abridgegame.org/darcs/">darcs</a> commands is something I hope <a href="https://www.selenic.com/mercurial/">hg</a> picks up; let's not do much more microparsing than we have to.

<p> <p> <a href="https://www.openid.net/">OpenID</a> looks kinda cool, but I don't quite see how it works; I hope they add a story/example showing what happens if a black hat puts my homepage URL in the field.

<p> <p> Some CVS (related) features I depend on that I wonder if/when hg has: emacs support (ctrl-x-v-v is burned into my medulla), keywords support.

<p> <p> Hmm... PHP is clearly the dominant server-side deployment vehicle these days. I wonder if its namespace management will catch up with Modula-3 and python... or if the .NET/mono CLR stuff has much chance; IronPython and the like look promising. I suppose JSP hosting is a commodity these days... and .Net... I wonder what the prices and trends are; and I wonder if there's mono hosting yet.

<p> <p> Hmm... a bunch more certs... ugh... they're all spam. How do I certify somebody as <b>pest</b> or <b>fraud</b> or <b>leech</b>?
