... skipping rocks.

This post is prompted by a desire to test the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/help/blogging/#55">flickr posting mechanism</a>, but I do love that photo. Mary took it at the <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/index.php">CSAIL</a> offsite meeting. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dckc/26854829/">Walking in the park</a> is another of my favorite moments from that trip.

The posting mechanism has a glitch... the body text got mangled with the title. I had to clean it up manually.

This is also a <a href="http://www.policyawareweb.org/">policy aware web</a> use case, since I had to give my breadcrumbs password to flickr to get this to work. Does <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID</a> solve that problem, or do we need something more flexible?
