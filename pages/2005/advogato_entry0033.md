So I'm helping my wife do some office work for a counsellor. We started with a bunch of .xls files. We exported those as text and normalized the data with a little python program and put it back into one big spreadsheet where she enters new data as it comes. We export the data as tab-separated text to run reports on it, in python again.

<p> <p> I think I could do the reports in excell with VBA. I have started up the learning curve, though I <em>really</em> don't like investing development effort in anything other than open source technology.

<p> <p> Meanwhile, I wrote the python code on my laptop, but the spreadsheet is on her mac mini. I though I'd use mercurial to allow me to make changes on either side and keep in sync.

<p> <p> But her machine doesn't have the developer tools installed, so it doesn't have gcc, so I can't install mercurial.
