Newspaper revenue has traditionally come from advertising. Craigslist
wiped out classified advertising and Google and Facebook get the
lion's share of digital advertising revenue<sup>[1]</sup>, which
dwarfs newspaper advertising revenue by 3x<sup>[2]</sup>.

Our kids can't tell the difference between real and fake news<sup>[3]</sup>.

The deep-learning robots at Google can caption photos as well as
humans<sup>[4]</sup>. How hard could it be to teach them to tell true
stories from fake? That is:

  - determine the main claims of an article
  - determine the level of support for these claims
  - determine whether promotion of the article is more likely to lead
    to spead of true or false information

The issue of bias via incomplete truth is perhaps a harder problem.
