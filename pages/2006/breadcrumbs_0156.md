title: 'how much do I want to know about drupal?'

<div><p>
breadcrumbs fell over, again, today. Disk full. Probably the spam database filled up with drek. Again. While googling for reports of similar problems, I discovered <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-4.7.0">drupal 4.7 is out</a> since May 1. They tout TimBL's blog in their release announcement. I wonder if they'd help us upgrade. Well, they do provide a video about upgrading. Maybe I'll find time to watch it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I discovered a couple interesting articles on the design/architecture of drupal and how PHP is used: <cite><a href="http://api.drupal.org/api/HEAD/file/developer/topics/oop.html">Drupal Programming from an Object-Oriented Perspective</a></cite> and the toungue-in-cheek <cite><a href="http://drupal.org/node/77487">The Road to Drupal Hell</a></cite>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how much of this I really want to know. As I said back in my <a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/11">october item on PHP angst</a>, I'm mostly playing simple customer when it comes to drupal.
But I'm having a hard time investing in technology that I don't know inside and out.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://chatlogs.planetrdf.com/swig/2006-08-04.html#T17-34-38">#swig discussion</a> where I was considering Zope alternatives (the one-big-file design has lost its charm), it occurred to me that I have read (parts of) the source to most everything that currently backs my personal web site Zope, the python interpreter, libc, various bits of debian infrastructure, and the linux kernel. I wonder when that will become totally impractical, and I'll understand my web site no more than I understand my car.</p>
