title: 'a quick take on Kiko, a nifty looking calendar service'
published: True
tags: ['breadcrumbs']

I just tried out <a href="http://www.kiko.com/">kiko</a>, an ajax calendar service. It looks kinda cool, but it failed to import my calendar data (&quot;invalid file&quot;) and contacts (spun forever). <em>Update: they fixed the problems I reported the same day, and they seem to have most of the relevant features I want planned. See comments for details.</em>  Hmm... reminders by IM is kinda interesting. But I&#39;m not sure I could rely on a remote service for that; it&#39;s critical that I be able to create/change appointments and get reminders in the middle of the day, even if I have no GPRS.  I reported the import problems and sent a feature request for subscribe.  hCalendar/hCard support would be cool too.
