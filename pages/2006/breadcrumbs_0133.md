<p>My regular schedule of working group meetings and conferences had a
gap in April, and my list of reasons to chat with <a
href="http://ben.adida.net/">Ben</a> was growing, and we're
recruiting some UROPs to work on the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/ajar/tab">tabulator project</a>
this summer, so I flew up for a visit to MIT.
</p>

<p>I didn't have any particular appointments the first day, so I used
the few spare minutes on the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBTA">T</a> between the airport and
MIT to scare up contacts using my <a
href="http://dm93.org/z2001/WearableGizmo">handheld gizmo</a>.  It
turned out <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/">Aaron</a> was in
town and available for lunch in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Square">Harvard Square.</a>
We talked about life in start-ups, standards orgs, and research. He
suggested layout stuff from Java and Apple should make its way into
CSS and offered to write up a few details.</p>

<p>I spent much of Thursday with Ben working on javascript hacks to
explore calendar data in RDFa. We did some whiteboard noodling about
RDFa and microformats.  He showed me the <a
href="http://www.squarefree.com/shell/">JavaScript shell</a>, which is
pretty cool... it gives a read-eval-print loop and tab completion in
firefox... just like a lisp machine ;-) <a
href="http://torrez.us/">Elias</a> dropped by and mixed in some
javascript hacking he's been doing to connect SPARQL with the google
calendar. Ben and I didn't get around converting <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2006/04dc-bos/midw-bos.html">my itinerary</a>
to RDFa like we planned, but we got pretty close; he sent out a <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf/2006Apr/0068.html">New
RDFa demo</a> the next day. That same day, he came down to meet with
me again, but I had to go work on a DARPA report, so we were trying to
figure out next steps, and he came up with a cool idea and sent it
out: <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf/2006Apr/0069.html">Proposal:
hGRDDL, an extraction from Microformats to RDFa</a>. Elias and I did
some whiteboard noodling too, in the neigborhood of <a
href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/99">JSON and templates
and microformats</a>.</p>

<p>Elias is learning more than he ever wanted
to about calendars and timezones. It's like
<a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2006-April/003681.html">Dougal Campbell said to microformats-discuss</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
My server is in timezone A, but I live in timezone B, but I'm posting information about an event that will occur in timezone C. Shoot me now.
</blockquote>

<p>On this trip, a <a
href="http://www.samsclub.com/shopping/navigate.do?dest=5&amp;item=151013">Samsonite
Dimension Notebook Case from SAM's</a> replaced my aging W3C bag in my
<a href="http://dm93.org/2005/dmjrnl/trav2005-09.html#travchk">travel
kit</a>.  I think I like all the little pockets and such, but I'm not
sure; sometimes I miss the simplicity of one big compartment.
I'm sure that I'm not happy that my Kensington K33069 Universal AC/Car/Air Adapter stopped working somewhere between MIT and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Mitchell_International_Airport">MKE</a>.
</p>

<p>That's one of the reason that I always pack some light reading on dead-trees.
I enjoyed escaping into Scott Lasser's
