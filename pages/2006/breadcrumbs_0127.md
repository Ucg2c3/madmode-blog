<p>Last month at SXSWi, I met up with <a
href="http://theryanking.com/blog/">Ryan King</a> and we seemed to be
on the same wavelength about developing test cases for <a
href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a>. A couple weeks ago,
we started <a
href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-dev/2006-March/000070.html">using
mercurial/hg to share microformats code, tests</a>. I try to sync up
with Ryan once a week or so. We had another busy day today.</p>

<p>We're still struggling a bit to shed our CVS habits
and learn hg's push/pull/merge routine, but we're
getting quite a bit of coding and testing done, as you can see in
<a href="http://hg.microformats.org/">hg.microformats.org</a>. </p>

<p>We talked a little about <a
href="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php#standards.indenting">line
lengths and tabs/indenting</a> and various other open source
housekeeping details.</p>

<p>I looked over some experimental code that Brian has added for
<tt>&lt;del></tt> support. I simplified one big XPath expression
and fixed a bug while I was at it, I think.</p>

<p>Brian's code is ahead of the specs when it comes to <tt>&lt;abbr
class="geo" title="41.9794444444;-87.9044444444"></tt> but it works
really well, in for example, <a href="http://austin.adactio.com/">the
SXSWi hCalendar/hCard/google-maps mash-up</a> so I expect it'll get
added to the specs and tests.</p>

<p>Earlier in the week, prompted by a #swig discussion of <a
href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/MicroModels">MicroModels</a>, i.e. GRDDL
and microformats, I collected some notes in the microformats wiki on
<a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/profile-uris">profile URIs</a>
to reflect some discussions we had in Austin.</p>
