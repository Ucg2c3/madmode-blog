<p>The last item on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2005/02/27-agenda.html">agenda of the TAG meeting in France</a> was "Reviewing what we have learned during a full <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/12/allgroupoverview.html">week of meetings</a>". I proposed that we do it on the beach, and it carried.</p>

<p>By then, the network woes of Monday and Tuesday had largely faded from memory.</p>

<p>I was on two of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/03/01-TechPlenAgenda.html">plenary day</a> panels. Tantek reports on one of them:
<cite><a href="http://microformats.org/blog/2006/03/02/microformats-voted-best-session-at-w3c-technical-plenary-day/">Microformats voted best session at W3C Technical Plenary Day!</a></cite>. My presentation in  that panel was on <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/g/talk62/slides">GRDDL and microformats</a>. Jim Melton followed with his SPARQL/SQL/XQuery talk. Between the two of them, Noah Mendelsohn said he thought the Semantic Web might just be turning a corner.</p>

<p>My other panel presentation was <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/Talks/0301-dc-afm/">Feedback loops and formal systems</a></cite> where I talked about UML and OWL after touching on contrast between symbolic approaches like the Semantic Web and statistical approaches like pagerank. Folksonomies are an interesting mixture of both, I suppose. <a href="http://www.cis.rl.ac.uk/Person/NAME=A.J.Miles;SECTION=PersonalDetails;">Alistair</a>
took me to task for being sloppy with the term "chaotic system"; he's quiet right that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system">complex system</a> is the more appropriate description of the Web.</p>
<p>The TAG discussion of that session started with jokes about how formal systems is soporific enough without putting it right after a big French lunch. TimBL mentioned the scheme denotational semantics, and TV said that <a href="http://mumble.net/~jar/">Jonathan Rees</a> is now at Creative Commons. News to me. I spent many, many hours poring over <a href="http://mumble.net/~jar/s48/index.html">his scheme48 code</a> a few years back. I don't think I knew where the name came from until today: <q>Within 48 hours we had designed and implemented a working Scheme, including read, write, byte code compiler, byte code interpreter, garbage collector, and initialization logic.</q></p>

<p>The <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/SwigAtTp2006">SemWeb IG meeting</a> on Thursday was full of fun lightning talks and cool hacks. I led a GRDDL discussion that went well, I think. The <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/SparqlCalendarDemo">SPARQL calendar demo</a> rocked. Great last-minute coding, Lee and Elias!</p>

<h2>There and back again</h2>

<p>On the return leg of <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/02dc-nce/aa-nce.html">my itinerary</a>, the captain announced the cruising altitude, as usual, and then added <q>... which means you'll spend most of today 6 miles above the earth.</q></p>

<p>My
<a href="http://dm93.org/2005/dmjrnl/trav2005-09.html#travchk">travel checklist</a> worked pretty well, with a few exceptions. The postcard thing isn't a habit yet. I forgot a paperback book; that was OK since I slept quite a bit on the way over and I got into <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?InTheZone">the coding zone</a> on the way back <em>more about that later, I hope</em>.</p>
