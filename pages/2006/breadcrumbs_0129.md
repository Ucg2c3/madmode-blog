title: 'Access control and version control: an over-constrained problem?'

<div>  <p>For a long time, when it came to sharing code, life was simple: everything went into the w3ccvs repository via ssh; when I commit WWW/People/Connolly/Overview.html the latest version is propagated out to all the web mirrors automatically and everybody can see the results at <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/">http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/</a>. I can also write via HTTP, using Amaya or any command-line tool with PUT support, e.g. curl.  The PUT results in a cvs commit, followed by the same mirroring magic.</p>  <p>We have a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/04/20-ACLs">forms-based system</a> for setting the access control for each file -- access control to the latest version, that is; access to older versions, to logs and the rest of the usual cvs goodies is limited to the few dozen people with access to the w3ccvs repository.</p>  <p>To overcome that limitation, Daniel Veillard set up <a href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/">dev.w3.org</a> which conforms more to the open source norms, providing anonymous read-only CVS access and web-browseable history. There is no http-based access control there, though CVS commit access is managed with ssh.</p>  <p>The downside of dev.w3.org is that it doesn&#39;t support web publishing like w3ccvs does. http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2001/palmagent/event-test.html is the cvs history of event-test.html, not the page itself. The address that gives the page itself is http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/~checkout~/2001/palmagent/event-test.html?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/html;%20charset=iso-8859-1. And every GET involves cvs reading the ,v file. And of course, relative links don&#39;t work.</p>  <p>For the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/">SWAP</a> project, we use a horrible kludge of both: we commit to w3cvs, and every 15 minutes, dev.w3.org is updated by rsync.</p>  <p>Then I have a personal web site, where I run Zope. That gives me thru-the-web editing with revision history/audit/undo, but at the cost of having the whole site in one big file on the server, and <em>no</em> local goodies like cvs diff. Ugh. I&#39;d like to switch to something else, but I haven&#39;t found anything else that talks webdav to iCal out-of-the-box. Plus, I can spare precious little time for sysadmin on my personal site, where there&#39;s basically just one user. I was really reluctant to use flickr.com URIs for my photos, but their tools are so much nicer that the alternative is that I basically don&#39;t publish photos at all. Plus, the social networking benefits of publishing on flickr are considerable. But that&#39;s really a separate point (or is it? hmm).</p>  <p>As I wrote in <a href="/breadcrumbs/node/69">a January item</a>, we&#39;re using svn in <a href="/">DIG</a>. DIG is part of CSAIL, which is a long-time kerberos shop. Public key authentication is so much nicer than shared key. I can use cvs or ssh over ssh to any number of places (mindswap, microformats, ...) with the same public key. But I need separate credentials (and a separte kinit step) for CSAIL. Ah... but it does propagate svn commit to http space in the right way. I think I&#39;ll try it ... see <a href="/2006/data4/">data4</a>.</p>  <p>I&#39;d rather use hg, which is peer-to-peer; it&#39;s theoretically possible to use svn as an hg peer, but that&#39;s slightly beyond the documented state-of-the-art.</p>  </div>
