<p>I fixed some markup errors in various of my posts last night. They all showed up on <a href="http://planetrdf.com">planetrdf</a> again.</p>

<p>Is drupal doing something buggy? Or is it pilot error? i.e. is there some way for me to tell drupal to change the updated date but not the... umm... whatever date planetrdf uses?</p>
