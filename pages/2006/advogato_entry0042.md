crap; This emacs CUA-mode doesn't really work. If I copy from firefox and ctrl-v in emacs, it pastes the last thing I yanked from emacs, not what I copied from firefox.

<p> <p> I rilllyrillyirillyrilly hate that.

<p> <p> I saw something about a gnome clipboard daemon... what's up with that? Ah...

<p> <blockquote>
<p>It was stupid of me to think that I had the power to fix the Clipboard
by creating one application. I don't have that power.

<p> <p> So is there some freedesktop.org standard brewing? Aha...

<p> <blockquote>
<p>Qt 3 and GNU Emacs 21 will use interpretation 2, changing the behavior of previous versions.

<p> <p> But... but...

<p> <pre>
$ apt-cache policy emacs21
emacs21:
  Installed: 21.4a-3
  Candidate: 21.4a-3
</pre>

<p> <p> So wtf?
