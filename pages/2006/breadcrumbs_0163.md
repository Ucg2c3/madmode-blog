<p>This has been such a stimulating week that I
wasn't sure how I was going to get it all into the web so that I could
share it with everybody effectively. Being able to go back between
editor and source views easily makes up for a number of quirks in the
editor tab.</p>


<p>@@Ok, I get it now: POST is the way to write to the web. nobody uses HTTP PUT cuz FTP can do that. (and rsync can do it better.)<br/>

</p>


<p>Flock gets points for XHTML, but</p>

<ul>
<li>it doesn't seem to grok &lt;abbr&gt; (which makes hCalendar hard) nor &lt;q&gt;</li>
<li>the drupal spreadfirefox theme uses XHTML strict where blockquote can only contain block elements, but flock puts other stuff there. I'm pretty happy with flock's use of transitional XHTML; I'd be happy to change the theme. But I want them to get along, one way or another.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
