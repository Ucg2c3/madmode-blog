<p>Speaking of <a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/85">checking specs against tests</a>, I suppose the first time I did that was when I was editing HTML 2. I maintained a <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-test/README.html">collection of tests</a> that I checked against the DTD whenever I changed it.</p>

<p>When we couldn't get other collaborators to install an SGML parser and do likewise, Mark Gaither and announced the
<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-html/1994Jul/0015">zero-install validation service</a>, a precursor to the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C markup validation service</a>.</p>

<p>I'm on an
<cite>Adventures in Formal Methods</cite>
panel at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/03/01-TechPlenAgenda.html">W3C tech plenary day</a>. I expect it will be useful to tell that story to make the point that <em>formalizing knowledge allows us to delegate tasks to the machine.</em></p>
