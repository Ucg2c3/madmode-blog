title: 'time, context, quoting, and reification'

<p>The time and context permathread has heated up again. I used to argue with TimBL endlessly about time context until I read <cite><a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/guha/guha-thesis.ps">Contexts: A Formalization and Some Applications</a></cite>; from <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/guha/">Guha&#39;s page at stanford</a>.</p> <!--break-->  <p>A <a href="http://www.nzlinux.org.nz/blogs/2006/03/20/why-we-need-explicit-temporal-labelling/">recent post</a> says:</p>  <blockquote> <p>What I’m suggesting is that we build versioning of statements directly into the model. That we make it easy to say:</p>  <pre>:article dc:title &quot;I like Cheeses&quot; [-&#39;19-Mar-2006&#39;]<br />:article dc:title “I like Cheese” [’20-Mar-2006′-]<br /></pre> </blockquote>  <p>Certainly this is one of the motivations for <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3">Notation3</a> as opposed to turtle. In N3, we write:</p>  <pre>{ :article dc:title &quot;I like Cheeses&quot; } holdsDuring &#39;19-Mar-2006&#39;.<br /></pre>  <p>The reification design in RDF 1.0 is badly broken. It looks like quoting, but it isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a huge distraction. I wish the RDF Core WG had had the courage to take it out. I should have pushed harder to take it out; leaving it in obscures the fact that we postponed the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/03/rdf-tracking/#rdfms-quoting">quoting issue</a>. The reification stuff that&#39;s left in RDF 1.0 is sending a lot of people down a counter-productive path.</p>  <p>Guha&#39;s work on context is available in the RDF/OWL work via the cyc time vocabulary. See especially <a href="http://www.cyc.com/cycdoc/vocab/time-vocab.html#subAbstractions">subAbstractions</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>...`AlbertEinsteinWhileAtPrinceton&#39; is a #$subAbstractions of `AlbertEinsteinAsAnAdult&#39;, which in turn is a #$subAbstractions of &#39;AlbertEinstein&#39;, which in turn is a #$subAbstractions only of itself (hence &#39;AlbertEinstein&#39; is an instance of #$Entity (q.v.)).</p> </blockquote>  <p>I wrote <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-calendar/2003Apr/0005.html">a message to www-rdf-calendar</a>  about cyc subabstractions in April 2003.</p>  <p>I pointed this out in a <a href="http://internetalchemy.org/2006/03/refactoring-bio-with-einstein-part-3-temporal-invariants#comment-2480">comment on Ian Davis&#39;s recent bio work</a>. It seemed to be news to him.</p>  <p>I did a <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/9711theory/ContextLogic.lsl">larch version of my understanding</a> as I read Guha&#39;s thesis in 2001. Graham&#39;s <a href="http://www.ninebynine.org/RDFNotes/RDFContexts.html">October 2000</a> and <a href="http://www.ninebynine.org/RDFNotes/UsingContextsWithRDF.html">March 2002</a> work are a more recent treatment (though I&#39;m less familiar with the latter).</p>  <p>I&#39;m pretty happy with N3 quoting in vocabularies like cyc as a solution to the time context issues.</p>  <p><em>See also: <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/fdesc54/slides.html">some slides on web architecture that touch on ist</a></em></p>
