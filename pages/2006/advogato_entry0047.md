<b>Worse is better for external disk enclosures too</b>

<p> <p> <p>I got a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usb">USB</a> 2.0 disk
enclosure this week. It's much quieter than the FireWire
enclosure I bought in Oct 2003. I thought surely it was
slower, but it's not.

<p> <p> <p>I learned assembly on a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6809">6809E</a>;
I thought people were crazy to deal with the 8-bit shackles
of the 6502 and the broken
segmented architecture of the 8086, though I
could see Intel beat Motorola to market with each new
generation. I'm a sucker for elegant technology. I paid the
SCSI premium for years. I never actually bought a NuBus Mac
nor a Newton, but I wanted to. I bought 2 PowerPC Macs, the
last one just before even Apple switched to Intel. But
slowly, I'm learning: worse is better. As a Web guy, I
should know that even a dollar per part is a lot when you're
talking about hundreds of millions of parts...

<p> <p> <blockquote>
However, Intel was not interested in paying the near-dollar
license fee to add an IEEE 1394 subsystem to their board.
The fee was reduced to a flat 25 cents, but Intel prefered
to push for its own USB 2.0 standard. As a result, they were
rarely provided as standard equipment on computers other
than Apple Macintosh computers (Apple owns rights to the
FireWire standard), and peripheral manufacturers offered
many more USB devices.

<p> <p> <p> I divested from SCSI a few years aog; all my disks are
commodity IDE now. I'm keeping an eye
on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA">SATA</a> but
haven't jumped yet.
