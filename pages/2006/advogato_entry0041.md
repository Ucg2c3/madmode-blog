<b><a href="http://www.cua.dk/">CUA-mode</a>, where have you been all my life?!?!?!</b> Found in some comments on <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/archives/2005/12/decent_editor_wanted.html">Gerv's search for an editor</a>. Could it be true? No more impedence mismatches between emacs's sense of paste and the rest of the gnome/mac/windows world?

<p> <p> Much of my hacking life has been spent in <a href="http://dm93.org/z2001/ToMacOrNotToMac">wondering whether to mac or not to mac</a>. I don't know how many times a day I curse emacs or firefox or gnome-terminal for screwing up copy-and-paste. I have so much angst every time I try... "if I close the window that I just copied from, will paste still work?" "oh crap! I don't want to paste what I just selected; I want to paste what I carefully spent 10 minutes copying to the clipboard!"

<p> <p> Speaking of to-Mac-or-not-to-Mac, and <a href="http://wolog.net/167009.html">imporovisation</a>, I wrote/discovered another little three chord ditty last night (did I mention I <em>love</em> having a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dckc/54920390/in/photostream/">piano in the house</a>?). Part of me wants to try out the western music notation support in Garage Band 2, but the rest of me knows that recording my knowledge using proprietary stuff is a step backwards. I have spent <a href="http://dm93.org/z2001/ThreeChordsAndTheTruth">many, many hours trying to get RoseGarden and the like working</a> under debian linux... preempt kernel patch... OSS vs ALSA vs Jack vs ARTS... argh! I look forward to the day when Ubuntu can afford to make it a priority.
