<p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our <a href="http://www.policyawareweb.org/">PAW</a> and <a href="/TAMI/">TAMI</a> projects, we&#39;re making a lot of progress on the practical aspects of proof exchange: in PAW we&#39;re working out the <a href="/2005/09/rein/examples/">nitty gritty details</a> of making an HTTP client (proxy) and server that exchange proofs, and in TAMI, we&#39;re working on user interfaces for audit trails and justifications and on integration with a truth maintenance system.</p>  <p>It doesn&#39;t concern me too much that <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/cwm">cwm</a> does some crazy stuff when <em>finding</em> proofs; it&#39;s the proof <em>checker</em> that I expect to deploy as part of trusted computing bases and the proof language specification that I hope will complete the Semantic Web standards stack.</p>  <p>But N3 proof exchange is no longer a completely hypothetical problem; the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-cwm-talk/2006AprJun/0015.html">first examples of interoperating with InferenceWeb</a> (via a mapping to PML) and <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-cwm-talk/2006AprJun/0024.html">with Euler</a> are working. So it&#39;s time to take a close look at the proof representation and the proof theory in more detail.</p>  <p>My trip to Austin for a <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/president/symposium/index.html">research library symposium at the University of Texas</a> gave me a chance to re-connect with <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/boyer/">Bob Boyer</a>. A while back, I told him about RDF and asked him about <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Logic">Semantic Web logic issues</a> and he showed me the proof checking part of McCune&#39;s <cite><a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~mccune/papers/robbins/">Robbins Algebras Are Boolean</a></cite> result:</p>  <blockquote><p>Proofs found by programs are always questionable. Our approach to this problem is to have the theorem prover construct a detailed proof object and have a very simple program (written in a high-level language) check that the proof object is correct. The proof checking program is simple enough that it can be scrutinized by humans, and formal verification is probably feasible.</p></blockquote><p>In my <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/sw99/2000JanMar/0002">Jan 2000 notes</a>, that excerpt is followed by...</p>  <blockquote><p>I offer a 500 brownie-point bounty to anybody who converts it to Java and converts the ()&#39;s in the input format to &lt;&gt;&#39;s.</p>  <p>5 points for perl. ;-)</p>  </blockquote><p>Bob got me invited to the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/seminar/index.html" class="summary">ACL2  seminar</a> this week; in my presentation, <cite><a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/09dc-aus/swpf">Toward proof exchange in the      Semantic Web</a></cite>. I reviewed a bit of Web Architecture and the standardization status of RDF, RDFS, OWL, and SPARQL as background to demonstrating that we&#39;re close to collecting that bounty. (Little did I know in 2000 that TimBL would <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/#L88">pick up python</a> so that I could avoid Java as well as perl ;-)<br /> </p>  <p> <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kaufmann/">Matt Kauffman</a> and company gave all sorts of great feedback on my presentation. I had to go back to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/09dc-aus/swpf#(8)"><em>Semantic Web Wave</em> diagram</a> a few times to clarify the boundary between research and standardization:</p>  <ul> <li>RDF is fully standardized/ratified<br /> </li> <li>turtle has the same expressive capability as RDF&#39;s XML syntax, but isn&#39;t fully ratified, and</li> <li>N3 goes beyond the standards in both syntax and expressiveness<br /> </li> </ul> <p>One of the people there who knew about RDF and OWL and such really encouraged me to get N3/turtle done, since every time he does any Semantic Web advocacy, the RDF/XML syntax is a deal-killer. I tried to show them my work on a turtle bnf, but what I was looking for was in <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-cwm-talk/2006AprJun/0032.html">June mailing list discussion</a>, not in my <a href="/breadcrumbs/node/85">February bnf2turtle breadcrumbs item</a>.<br /> </p>  <p>They asked what happens if an identifier is used before it appears in an <strong>@forAll</strong> directive and I had to admit that I could test what the software does if they wanted to, but I couldn&#39;t be sure whether that was by design or not; exactly how quantification and {}s interact in N3 is sort of an open issue, or at least something I&#39;m not quite sure about.<br /> </p>  <p>Moore noticed that our conjunction introduction (CI) step doesn&#39;t result in a formula whose main connective is conjuction; the conjuction gets pushed inside the quantifiers. It&#39;s not wrong, but it&#39;s not traditional CI either.<br /> </p>  <p>I asked about ACL2&#39;s proof format, and they said what goes in an ACL2 &quot;book&quot; is not so much a proof as a sequence of lemmas and such, but Jared was working on <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/jared/milawa/Web/">Milawa</a>, a simple proof checker that can be extended with new prooftechniques.</p>  <p>I started talking a little after 4pm; different people left at different times, but it wasn&#39;t until about 8 that Matt realized he was late for a squash game and headed out.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dckc/243400207/" title="MLK and the UT Tower"><img src="https://static.flickr.com/89/243400207_61c4f60b5a_t.jpg" border="0" alt="MLK and the UT Tower" width="75" height="100" align="left" /></a>I went back to visit them in the U.T. tower the next day to follow up on ACL2/N3 connections and Milawa.  Matt suggested  a translation of N3 quantifiers and {}s into ACL2 that doesn&#39;t involve quotation. He offered to guide me as I fleshed it out, but I only got as far as <a href="http://chatlogs.planetrdf.com/swig/2006-09-14.html#T15-12-39">installing lisp and ACL2</a>; I was too tired to get into a coding fugue.</p>  <p>Jared not only gave me some essential installation clues, but for every technical topic I brought up, he printed out two papers showing different approaches. I sure hope I can find time to follow up on at least some of this stuff.<br /> </p>  <p style="font-size: 10px; text-align: right">del.icio.us tags:<a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/connolly/Austin">Austin</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/connolly/semantic">semantic</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/connolly/web">web</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/connolly/logic">logic</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://del.icio.us/connolly/research">research</a></p><p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" target="_new" title="Flock">Flock</a></p>
