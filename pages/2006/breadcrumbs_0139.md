<p>I went to Edinburgh last week for <a
href="http://www2006.org/">WWW2006</a>.
</p>

<p>I spent Tuesday in the workshop on <a
href="http://www.ibiblio.org/hhalpin/irw2006/">Identity, Reference,
and the Web (IRW2006)</a>.  I didn't really finish my <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2006/04/irw65/talk">presentation slides</a> in
time, but I think my paper, <cite><a
href="http://www.w3.org/2006/04/irw65/urisym">A Pragmatic Theory of
Reference for the Web</a></cite> is mostly coherent.  Each section of
the workshop got an entry in a semantic wiki; mine is <a
href="http://wiki.ontoworld.org/index.php/IRW2006_12:00">the one that
started at 12:00</a>.</p>

<p>The IRE formalism presented by Valentina and Aldo was
though-provoking.  I think their <tt>proxy-for</tt> is like foaf:topic
(modulo the way they mix in time). And <tt>exact-proxy-for</tt> is
like foaf:primaryTopic. Very handy.  I wonder if foaf:primaryTopic
should be promoted to its own thing, separate from all the social
networking stuff in foaf.</p>

<p>Ginsberg's talk hit on one of the most important questions: "Do I
commit to a document just because I use one of its terms?"  His answer
was basically to reify everything; I think we can do better than
that. Peter Patel-Schneider's talk basically gave a 'no' answer
to the question. I don't think we should go that far either, though
from a standardization point of view, that's sorta where we're at.</p>

<p>Steve Pepper's talked about published subjects and public resource
identifiers; I can sympathize with his point that we have too many
URL/URI/URN/IRI/XRI/etc.  terms, but when he suggests that the answer
is to make a new one, I'm not sure I agree.  He argues to deprecate
all the others, but as URI Activity lead at W3C, I'm not in a position
where I can overrule people and deprecate things that they say they
want. I agree with him that the 303 redirection is too much trouble,
but he doesn't seem to be willing to use the <a
href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/HashURI">HashURI pattern</a> either, and
as I said in the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2006/04/irw65/urisym#adv">advice section of my
paper</a>, that's asking for trouble.</p>

<p>On Thursday, I was on a panel about tagging versus the Semantic
Web: <cite><a
href="http://www2006.org/programme/item.php?id=panel01">Meaning on the
Web: Evolution or Intelligent Design?</a></cite>.
Frank started by debunking 4 myths about the Semantic Web.
<em>I gotta find Frank's slides.</em>
"I'll hold up one finger whever anybody says myth #1, and so on."
As the the other Frank was talking about tagging, Frank held
up 2 and 3 fingers, and the audience pointed out that he should
have held up 1 finger.</p>

<p>I talked without slides. I think I got away with it. I said
that I don't expect symbolic reasoning to beat statistical
methods when it comes to the <q>wisdom of crowds</q>, but
who wants to delegate their bank balance or the targets
of their mail messages to the wisdom of crowds? Sometimes
we mean <em>exactly</em> what we say, not just something close.</p>

<p>I suggested that <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/mash/slides">GRDDL+microformats</a>
is a practical way to get lots of Semantic Web data.  And I brought up
the <a
href="http://microformats.org/wiki/datetime-design-pattern">problem
with iCalendar timezones</a> and noted that while timezones data
should be published by the government entities that govern them, <a
href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/91">Semantic Web data
from wikipedia</a> might be a more straightforward mechanism and might
be just as democratic.</p>

<p>So much for philosophical discussions; stay tuned for another
item about SPARQL and databases and running code.</p>
