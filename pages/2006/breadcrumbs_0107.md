title: 'hacking soccer schedules into hCalendar and into my sidekick'

<p>When I gave a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/g/talk62/slides">microformats+GRDDL</a> talk early this month, I listed my kid&#39;s soccer schedules on my <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/g/talk62/slides#(10)">wish list</a> slide.</p>  <p>Those soccer schedules are now available. No matter how badly I need them in my sidekick calendar in order to coordinate other family activities, I couldn&#39;t bear the thought of manually keying them in. <strong>The bane of my existence is doing things that I know the computer could do for me.</strong><sup><a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/webmatters/xml/xml.html">1998</a>,<a href="http://www.w3.org/Talks/2002/10/09-swcal/all.htm">2002</a></sup></p>   <p>One of the schedules is in PDF. I toyed with a <a href="http://www.solidpdf.com/">PDF to excel converter</a> and with google&#39;s &quot;view as HTML&quot; cache feature but didn&#39;t get very far with those. But the other schedule is on a normal <a href="http://www.htgsports.net/">database-backed web site</a>.</p>  <p>It took just 91 lines of XSLT to put <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar">hCalendar</a> markup to the page. Each event was a row; I added a tbody element around each row so that I could use the row element as the class=&quot;description&quot; element. I used an <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/XSLT/Recipe/415002">ASP recipie</a> to figure out how to just add an attribute here and there and leave the rest alone. I didn&#39;t get the AM/PM XSLT code right the first time; silly, since I&#39;ve written it before; I should have copied it, if not factored it out for reuse.</p>  <p>My PDA/cellphone is a t-mobile sidekick. There&#39;s a very nice XMLRPC interface to the data, but it went read-only and it&#39;s not supported, so I use a <a href="http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/ClientForm/">ClientForm</a> screen-scraping hack to upload flight schedules and such to my PDA. hipAgent.py (in my <a href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2001/palmagent/">palmagent</a> project) gets its data thru a simple command-line interface or thru tab-separated text files. I had a set of eventlines.n3 rules for reducing RDF calendar data to tab-separated format, but its timezone support is quirky and it doesn&#39;t handle multi-line descriptions. So I bit the bullet and integrated cwm&#39;s RDF reader via the simple <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/myStore">myStore</a> API into hipAgent.py. I was simple enough:</p>  <pre><br />        elif o in (&quot;--importRDF&quot;,):<br />            import uripath, os<br />            from myStore import load # http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/<br />            addr = uripath.join(&quot;file:&quot; + os.getcwd() + &quot;/&quot;, a)<br />            kb = load(addr)<br />            importTimedRDF(number, passwd, kb, icon<br /><br />...<br /><br />    from myStore import Namespace<br />    RDF = Namespace(&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;)<br />    ICAL = Namespace(&#39;http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/icaltzd#&#39;)<br /><br />    for ev in kb.each(pred = RDF.type, obj = ICAL.Vevent):<br />        titl = unicode(kb.the(subj = ev, pred = ICAL.summary)).encode(&quot;utf-8&quot;)<br />        progress(&quot;== found event:&quot;, titl)<br /><br />        when = str(kb.the(subj = ev, pred = ICAL.dtstart))<br />        dt = when[:10]<br />        ti = when[11:16]<br />        <br />        loc = kb.any(subj = ev, pred = ICAL.location)<br />        if loc: loc = unicode(loc).encode(&quot;utf-8&quot;)<br />        desc = kb.any(subj = ev, pred = ICAL.description)<br />        if desc: desc = unicode(desc).encode(&quot;utf-8&quot;)<br />        <br />        progress(&quot;a.addTimedEvent&quot;, dt, ti)<br />        a.addTimedEvent(dt, ti,<br />                        titl, desc,<br />                        &#39;minutes&#39;, 60, #@@hardcoded<br />                        where=loc)<br /> </pre>  <p>So I succesfully loaded son&#39;s soccer schedule into my sidekick PDA calendar:</p>  <ol>   <li>GET the schedule</li>   <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/">tidy</a> it</li>   <li>add hCalendar markup (vevent, description, summary dtstart, location) using XSLT</li>   <li>convert to RDF/XML using a GRDDL transform for hCalendar, <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/12/cal/glean-hcal.xsl">glean-hcal.xsl</a></li>   <li>load into sidekick using hipAgent.py</li> </ol>  <p>The folks running the DB-backed web site could add hCalendar markup with even less hassle then I did (though they might have to think a little bit to produce well-formed XHTML), at which point I could reduce the first 4 steps with GRDDL (either via remote service or by adding GRDDL support to hipAgent.py or to cwm&#39;s myStore.load() function).</p>
