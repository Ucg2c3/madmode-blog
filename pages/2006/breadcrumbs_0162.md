title: 'Wishing for XOXO microformat support in OmniOutliner'
published: True
tags: ['breadcrumbs']

<p>OmniOutliner is great; I used it to put together the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/09dc-aus/ap90">panel remarks</a> I mentioned an earlier breadcrumbs item.</p>

<p>The XHTML export support is quite good, and even their native format is XML.
But it's a bit of a pain to remember to export each time I save so that I can keep the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/09dc-aus/ap90.ooutline">ooutline version</a> and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/09dc-aus/ap90.html">XHTML version</a> in sync.</p>

<p>Why not just use an XHTML dialect like <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/xoxo">XOXO</a> as the native format? I wonder what, if anything, their native format records that XOXO doesn't cover and couldn't be squeezed into XHTML's spare bandwidth somewhere.</p>

<p>There's also the question of whether XOXO can express anything that OmniOutliner can't handle, I suppose.</p>
