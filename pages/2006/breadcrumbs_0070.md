title: 'Using truth maintenance techniques in RDF stores?'
published: True
tags: ['breadcrumbs']

<p>Almost every RDF store actually stores more than triples; they store &quot;quads&quot; or &quot;contexts&quot; or provenance or something...</p>  <p>The cwm <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/formula.html">formula interface</a> used to use (f, p, s, o), where <em>f</em> was the formula in which the triple occured; then it grew to (f, p, s, o, why) where <em>why</em> was a proof structure. Another common pattern is (s, p, o, source), where <em>source</em> points to a file/resource that the triple was loaded from. In <a href="/breadcrumbs/node/62">re-writing an RDF store for tabulator</a>, TimBL seems to be settling calling that 4th column <em>why</em>, which works like <em>source</em> in common cases. This is inspired at least in part by some <a href="http://swiss.csail.mit.edu/~cph/6.898/tms-html/index.html">truth maintenance stuff</a> that Chris presented Oct 6 2005 in the <a href="/2005/09/6.898/">Notions and Notations class</a>.</p>  <p>Meanwhile, Edd observes <a href="http://times.usefulinc.com/2006/01/16-trends">lots of submissions about RDF Stores for XTech 2006</a>. I hope that folks building stores look at TMS architectures.
