<p> <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2005/09/20-whiteoard/"><img style="margin: 1em" src="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2005/09/20-whiteoard/20050922-093038.jpg-tmb.jpg" alt="diagram on whiteboard" align="left" /></a> Back in September, the TAG had this great <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2005/09/22-tagmem-minutes.html#item02">whiteboard discussion of versioning</a>. </p>  <p> <img style="margin: 1em" src="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2005/09/22-diagram1.png" alt="versioning diagram" align="right" /> TimBL captured an <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2005/09/22-diagram1.graffle">omnigraffle version</a>, which is nice because it&#39;s XML and I can convert it to RDF with XSLT, but it&#39;s a mac thing and Dave Orchard, who&#39;s doing most of the relevant writing, was more inclined to building UML diagrams with Visio. Then Henry Thompson found this <a href="http://www.horstmann.com/violet/">violet</a> tool that&#39;s just what we need: a light-weight, cross-platform (Java, in this case) editor that produces pretty clean XML representations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram">UML class diagrams</a>.</p>   <p>This week, Dave sent an <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xml-versioning/2006Feb/0000.html">update</a> on the terminology section.</p>  <p>That was just the prompt I was looking for to swap in my work on <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-swbp-wg/2005Sep/0136">formally defining W3C&#39;s namespace change policy options</a> from last September. I thought for a while about how to test that the RDF version of the UML diagram was right, and I realized I could get cwm to smush producers and consumers based on cardinality constraints.</p>  <p>First we extract RDF from the UML diagram...</p> <pre><a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/2006/ext-vers/">ext-vers</a>$ make test-agent-pf.n3<br />xsltproc ... --output ext-vers-uml.rdf grokVioletUML.xsl ext-vers-uml.violet<br /></pre>  <p>... and then we mix with some rules to implement OWL cardinalities...</p>  <pre>python $swap/cwm.py ext-vers-uml.rdf test-agent.n3 \<br />owl-excerpt.n3 rdfs-excerpt.n3 --think \<br />--filter=test-agent-goal.n3  --why &gt;test-agent-pf.n3<br /></pre>  <p>And indeed, it concludes a1 = a2.</p>  <p><em>I&#39;m working on getting a proof/justification using --why and some proof browsing tools, but that&#39;s another story.</em></p>   <p>One of the reasons I&#39;m pleased with this ontology that the TAG came up with in Edinburgh is that it allows me to formalize the concept of <em>sublanguage</em> that I have heard TimBL talk about now and again. For example:</p>  <ol>   <li> HTML2 is a sublanguage of HTML4.</li>   <li> a production of chap2 is in HTML2; the intent is chap1in</li>   <li> a consumption of chap2, ?C is in HTML4</li>   <li> Show: ?C intent chap1in</li>   <li> ?C intent chap1in by 1, 2, 3 and defn sublanguage</li> </ol>  where the definition of sublanguage is:  <pre>{<br />  [] ev:text ?TXT; :language [ is :sublanguage of ?BIG ]; :intent ?I.<br />  ?COMM ev:text ?TXT; :language ?BIG.<br />} =&gt; { ?COMM :intent ?I }.<br />{<br />  [] ev:text ?TXT; :language ?BIG; :impact ?I.<br />  ?COMM ev:text ?TXT; :language [ is :sublanguage of ?BIG ].<br />} =&gt; { ?COMM :impact ?I }.<br /></pre>
