<p>SxSWi looks to be quite the <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/PathCross">PathCross</a>:
The <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP060038">microformats panel</a> on Monday is what put the conference on my radar this year, but it's just one of dozens of panels that I really want to see. It's overwhelming. Of course, that's part of the appeal of the Austin/SXSW scene: creative chaos. As a student, my creed was "never plan more than 15 minutes ahead." Life was much simpler, in many ways, back then.</p>

<p>Other stuff I'm looking forward to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Saturday: Matt May's <a href="http://www.bestkungfu.com/archive/date/2006/03/set-your-compasses/">invitation</a> to a social event looks interesting.</li>
<li>Sunday: <a href="http://upcoming.org/promo/sxsw2006party">Flickr, Upcoming.org, and Del.icio.us in the company of Yahoo!</a>. I RSVP'd, but so did 390 other people. If the Iron Cactus were big enough to fit all of us, I: think I would remember it. Oh... hmm... it seems to be on 6th street; the names on the clubs there rotate with the seasons; some of them big enough, if we don't all show up at once.</li>
<li>Tuesday: <a href="http://www.lawver.net/archive/2006/03/07/h13_conferences_conferences.php">Kevin Lawver</a>: <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP060065">How to Convince Your Company to Embrace [Web] Standards</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.hackdiary.com/archives/000078.html">MattB will be there</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I'm driving down with <a href="http://dm93.org/">Mary and the boys</a>, stopping to visit folks here and there.</p>

<p>And on Tuesday night, my <a href="http://www.w3.org/2006/03dc-aus-lga/ticket234">itinerary</a> takes me to New York for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Security/usability-ws/">W3C workshop on usability and authorization</a>.</p>
