<p><a
href="http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikimania
2006</a> was last week in Boston; I had it on my travel schedule,
tenatively, months in advance, but I didn't really come up with a
solid justification, and there were conflicts, so I ended up not
going.</p>

<p>I was very interested to see the <a
href="http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimania_online">online
participation options</a>, but I didn't get my hopes up too high,
because I know that
<a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/ConnectingAudiences">ConnectingAudiences</a>
is challenging.</p>

<p>I tried to participate in the <a
href="http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/Transcription">transcription
stuff</a> real-time; installation of the <a
href="http://darcs.0x539.de/trac/obby/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/Download">goby
collaborative editor</a> went smoothly enough (it looks like an
interesting alternative to SubEthaEdit, though it's client/server, not
peer-to-peer; they're talking about switching to the jabber
protocol...)  but I couldn't seem to connect to any
sessions while people were active in them.</p>

<p>The real-time video feed of <a
href="http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proceedings:BMH1">mako
on a definition of Freedom</a> was surprisingly good, though I
couldn't give it my full attention during the work day. I didn't
understand the problem he was speaking to (<em>isn't GFDL good
enough?</em>) until I listened to <a
href="http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proceedings:LL1">Lessig
on Free Culture</a> and realized that CC share-alike and GFDL don't
interoperate. <em>(Yet another reason to keep the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Principles#TOII">test of
independent invention</a> in mind at all times.)</em>
</p>

<p>Lessig read this quote, but only referred to the author using a
photo that I couldn't see via the audio feed; when I looked it up, I
realized there was a gap in this student's free culture education:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we don't want to live in a jungle, we must change our
  attitudes. We must start sending the message that a good citizen is
  one who cooperates when appropriate, not one who is successful at
  taking from others.</p>

  <cite><a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/shouldbefree.html">RMS,
  1992</a></cite>
</blockquote>

<p>These sessions on the wikipedia process look particularly
interesting; I hope to find time to see or listen to a recording:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a
  href="http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proceedings:SG2">The
  Process of Requests for Adminship on the English Wikipedia: The Role
  of Trust in an Open System</a></li>

  <li><a
  href="http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proceedings:MP1">A
  Question-and-answer session with the English Wikipedia Arbitration
  Committee</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I bumped into TimBL online and remind him about the <a
href="http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proceedings:DV2">Wikipedia
and the Semantic Web</a> panel; he had turned it down because of other
travel obligations, but he just managed to stop by after all. I hope
it went allright; he was pretty jet-lagged.</p>

<p>I see <a href="http://www.wikisym.org/ws2006/">WikiSym 2006</a>
coming up August 21-23, 2006 in Odense, Denmark. I'm not sure I can
find justification to make travel plans on just a few weeks of
notice. But Denny's <cite><a
href="http://semantic.nodix.net/2006/08/maybe-hottest-conference-ever.html">hottest
conference ever</a></cite> item burns like salt in an open wound and
motivates me to give it a try. It looks like the <a
href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/acacia/soft/sweetwiki.html">SweetWiki</a>
folks, who participate in the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/grddl-wg/">GRDDL WG</a>, will be
there; that's the start of a justification...</p>
