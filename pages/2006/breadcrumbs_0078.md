<p>Just after I saw the <a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2006/02/01/rssrip">news that Norm is killing his RSS feed</a> in favor of Atom, in my city's <a href="http://opkansas.org/overview/index.cfm">newsletter</a>, they tout that they're starting to use RSS.</p>

<p>
<em>They don't seem to keep back issues of the newsletter online, and their markup is invalid. Maybe they'd better study some of the older technologies like URIs and HTML before moving up to RSS</em>.
</p>

<p>Escaped markup really is nasty. Is there a way to do it with rdf:parseType="Literal" that works? Why isn't this answer readily available from a test suite? There are validation services for RSS and Atom, and I'm sure various tools have various regression suites, but I don't see much in the way of collaborative development of test suites for feeds.</p>

<p>I've done a little bit of work on <a href="http://www.microformats.org/wiki/hcard-tests">hCard testing</a>; I try to stay test-driven as I write <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/g/data-view">GRDDL</a> transformations for <a href="http://www.microformats.org/">microformats</a>. I'd like to find more time for that sort of thing.</p>
