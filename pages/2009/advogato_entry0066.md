still outfitting this netbook... well, I brought the acer 
back and got the msi Wind U120 that I asked for in the 1st 
place.

<p> The . key is tiny and shifte over a little. I regularly 
hit / when I mean . and I don't know whether I'll be able 
to retrain myself.

<p> I'd like to try the Ubuntu netbook remix; Ubuntu recommends 
putting a jaunty jackalope daily build on flash drive; I 
tried that, but (a) it took forever to write 1GB+ to a 
flash drive and (b) the machine won't boot from flash drive.

<p> Wubi worked, but having my Ubuntu world live inside NTFS 
doesn't feel right.

<p> I have an external USB CD drive; I'll eventually use that 
to re-install, I think.

<p> Meanwhile, Ubuntu doesn't seem to grok the wireless card. 
(There's a bug in launchpad and I subscribed to it. IOU one 
link...)

<p> So I'm trying out Windows for the 1st time in years. I want 
to update one of my hg-backed web sites. TortoiseHg seems 
like a good approach... the 1st N attempts to download it 
yielded "file is corrupt" when I tried to run it; I didn't 
think switching from chrome to Opera would help, but it 
did. Hmm... could chrome really screw up downloading that 
badly?

<p> Now I'm trying cygwin and ssh and such. Wish me luck...
