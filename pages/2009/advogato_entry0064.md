<strong>Family business blog: drupal or
wordpress? self-managed or hosted?</strong>

<p> <p> The <a href="http://www.kcwebpros.com/">Kansas
City Web Professionals</a> meet this Wednesday. I started to
post to their <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1190987">linkedin
group</a> about my recent trip to Web Directions
North, but I figured hey: why drive ad revenue on linkedin
rather than my own consulting business site, <a href="http://www.midwestwebsense.com/">Midwest Web Sense</a>?

<p> <p> But that site needs some maintenance.
I set up <a href="http://www.midwestwebsense.com/stories/">drupal on
nearlyfreespeech.net</a> and tried to get
OpenID working with it... when I ran into glitches, I
learned I'm already a major version behind. And the other
drupal site in my life, <a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/">breadcrumbs</a>
is falling apart because the drupal guy in our research
group moved on.

<p> <p> Yesterday, Kyle, my 9 year old son, agreed to help. So I
explained about hosted blogs vs running your own, and where
the ad revenue goes, and such.

<p> <p> We had a fun hack session in my office; you can see his work
on <a href="http://choderbug.wordpress.com/">choderbug</a>
and as <a href="http://twitter.com/wsouski">wsouski on
twitter</a>. I think he's starting to grok the community values:

<p> <p> <blockquote>
@wsouski don't be a spammer, wsouski. don't be a spammer.
</blockquote>


<p> <p>Update: the  
<a href="http://chatlogs.planetrdf.com/swig/2009-02-22.html#T21-23-46">WP
domains clue</a> from mhausenblas in #swig was just
the ticket to set up notes.midwestwebsense.com:
<a href="http://notes.midwestwebsense.com/2009/02/22/12/">Web
Directions North ski trip was a blast!</a>
