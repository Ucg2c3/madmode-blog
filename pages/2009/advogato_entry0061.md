<strong>Still struggling to catalog CDs</strong>

<p> <p> I'd like to catalog a bunch of CDs. My cuecat isn't working
today; I'm not sure why not. And even if it were,
<a href="http://alexandria.rubyforge.org/">alexandria</a>
fails to make heads or tails of the list of ISBNs that I
captured last time it worked.

<p> <p> I'm not quite ready to pay $40 for <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicous Library
2</a>, but I'm getting there.


<p> <p> <a href="http://zebra.sourceforge.net/">zebra</a> looks
interesting; I like the idea of scanning barcodes with a webcam.

<p> <p> I couldn't get the firewire DV camera that works great with
kino to work with cheese or ekiga any other v4l app; dunno why.

<p> <p> I broke out the old USB webcams; they still don't work.
lsusb shows them as:

<p> <p> <pre>
046d:08b2 Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Pro 4000
0545:8333 Xirlink, Inc. Veo Stingray/Connect Web Camera
046d:0870 Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Express
0733:0401 ViewQuest Technologies, Inc. CS330 WebCam
</pre>

<p> <p> lots of this:

<p> <p> <pre>
$ cheese
libv4l2: error dequeuing buf: Input/output err
</pre>

<p> <p> The Ubuntu community seems to track this as <a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libv4l/+bug/260918/">Bug
#260918</a>; I just subscribed.


<p> p.s. quicken records show:

<p> <ul>
<li>2001/12/09 Best Buy Xirlink VEO PC Camera $26.74

<li>2001/12/29 Best Buy veo pc camera 26.74
