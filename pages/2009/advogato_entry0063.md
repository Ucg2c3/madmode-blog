I found something I was looking for via ohloh tonight... the
only thing it knows about me is that I made a handful of
commits to the W3C validation service in 2001. I started a
<a href="https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/connolly">profile</a>
and registered cwm as a project, but there wasn't enough
instant gratification to keep me at it...
