title: 'DIG losing the battle with spammers again'
published: True
tags: ['breadcrumbs']

<p>Blog spam went out of control again; the only remedy I could find was a very big hammer: turn off the drupal comments module altogether and in doing so, unpublish all comments ever posted to this site. I suppose they&#39;re still in the database and could be published again, if we could separate them from the spam. </p><p>The drupal expertise in our group seems to have gone on to greener pastures. That prompted me to <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/connolly/diary/64.html">divest from my family business drupal installation and start a hosted wordpress site</a> and makes me wonder how safe is stuff that I write here... </p><p>Any MIT students want to help this research group manage a community presence?
