<b>Roach motel indeed; sidekick XMLRPC service
is no more</b>

<p> I went back to the most recent (2008-03) of my
<a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/taxonomy/term/28">calendar
sync items in the DIG breadcrumbs research blog</a> and got
hipwsgi.py from 
<a href="http://bitbucket.org/DanC/palmagent/">palmagent</a>
 fired up, only to get
"Connection refused" from pimapi.prod1.dngr.net.

<p> Uh-oh.

<p> I thought I could write off the sidekick altogether at that
point, but:

<p> <ol>
<li>Organizing weekend todo lists works with the sidekick in
a way that I haven't managed to duplicate: lists on paper
don't sort themselves by priority and due date; Google
calendar tasks don't sync with the sidekick (nor with any
usable android app that I could find).

<p> <li>How do I call my brother from the car? Using a mobile
phone without my contacts would be like using the Web
without DNS.


<p> <li>Android's crummy appointment notification reminded me
how much I rely on a gizmo to beep when I'm supposed to stop
coding and go to my appointment with the Doctor. Delegating
this to a gizmo goes back to ~1996 when I first got a Psion
PDA. (see <a href="http://www.w3.org/Tools/pypsion/">some
python code for psion files</a>)

</ol>

<p> I'm not sure how I'm going to muddle thru this mix of google
calendar/contacts stuff and sidekick phone... maybe I can
use SMS reminders for calendar stuff, but you never know how
long those things are going to take to be delivered;
T-Mobile seems to deliver them 13 hours later in some cases.

<p> For now, I'm going to pickle some state...
